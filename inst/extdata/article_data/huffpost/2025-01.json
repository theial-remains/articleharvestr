    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s efforts to suppress or rewrite the history of his raucous first term in office — and especially what happened at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — have gone unabated for years. As he prepares to take office again, a great memory-holing could soon begin. Trump has made revisionism a cornerstone of his political career — a feature, not a bug. He regularly distorts facts and often denies any culpability of wrongdoing even if, for example, crimes he was alleged to have committed were proven beyond a reasonable doubt in court and he was convicted by a judge and jury. Trump has vowed to sign a slew of executive orders once back in the White House. And from Day One, he will be buoyed by Republican majorities in Congress, albeit slim ones. The Republican Party has, over the last four years, become increasingly pliant to Trump’s every wish or whim, even if that means playing down certain facts about the mob bearing Trump flags and banners that broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Unchained from nearly a half dozen indictments and imbued with great though vague powers of immunity by a majority-conservative Supreme Court justices, several of whom he hand-selected, one of the only things to stop a great rewriting of the nation’s recent history will be the efforts of the public to hold fast to facts instead of fiction. Here’s what Trump might try to distance himself from, once he’s back in office: As Trump promises to pardon Jan. 6 rioters who stormed the Capitol on his behalf, prosecutors, FBI agents and even Proud Boys who’ve testified in court have pointed to one comment from Trump in the lead-up to the 2020 election that helped spark the violence to come. At a debate against Joe Biden in 2020, he refused to disavow extremist groups like the Proud Boys, saying instead that they should “stand back and stand by.” The Proud Boys had long considered themselves a “drinking club with a political problem,” according to defense lawyers, but Trump’s remark shifted the atmosphere. It became an instant rallying cry and powerful recruitment tool for the Proud Boys, according to extensive witness testimony, texts and chats presented at the Proud Boys’ seditious conspiracy trial in 2023. Proud Boys leaders were inundated with messages from people who sought to join the group to support Trump and crush their perceived enemies. Prior to Trump’s comment, the group had for years mostly been disorganized but had been eager to grow their ranks or find a purpose. That moment spawned significant outreach among Proud Boys chapters around the country. And it gave rise to multiple secret or encrypted text channels, where leaders of the extremist group would later coordinate their attack on the Capitol. On the witness stand at the seditious conspiracy trial of onetime Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio and Proud Boys leaders Joe Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Ethan Nordean, one FBI special agent testified under oath that communications among group members after the debate were jubilant because they believed Trump was telling them that he needed them. After Trump lost to Biden, texts the FBI obtained from Proud Boys’ devices showed Tarrio discussing the election results, writing that it would be “dark times” if the results weren’t reversed — and “if it’s reversed, civil war.” Members responded by saying civil war was necessary “no matter what.” There was no toning down of that rhetoric from Tarrio nor any other leader associated with the group. With their newfound confidence, throughout November and December 2020, Proud Boys attended rallies in D.C. for Trump aimed at stopping the “steal” and ended up clashing in the street with counterprotesters. Former Proud Boys leader Jeremy Bertino, who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, was stabbed by a counterprotester after one of those rallies, and it became a seminal moment. He testified at Tarrio’s trial that the Proud Boys were upset because they believed police weren’t doing enough to protect them from anti-Trump demonstrators or individuals they deemed members of antifa. Bertino’s stabbing spurred the group’s animosity toward police, and that resentment grew until it was allowed to explode on Jan. 6. When Trump announced on Dec. 19, 2020, that there would be a “wild” rally in D.C. on Jan. 6, they went into overdrive. The Justice Department told jurors at the Proud Boys trial that leaders of the group knew they lacked discipline, generally speaking, but were open to using whatever means necessary to achieve their ends. On Jan. 6, Capitol Police reported seeing as many as 200 Proud Boys in the crowd. While that was a lot, it wasn’t enough to forcibly stop the transfer of power — and leaders of the group knew that going in, according to federal prosecutors. They would have to rely on something that became known as the “tools theory,” prosecutors revealed: By agreeing to whip up the “normies,” or everyday people, who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, they would have the sheer force they needed to stop the certification in its tracks. Testimony provided to the congressional committee investigating Jan. 6, as well as records, witness testimony and evidence from the Oath Keepers seditious conspiracy trial in 2022 showed that there were few degrees of separation between Trump and associates or members of the extremist groups that stormed the Capitol. Kellye SoRelle, former general counsel to the far-right anti-government Oath Keepers network and former girlfriend of Oath Keepers leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes, is one such example. SoRelle, who was sentenced to a year in prison on Friday, was a vocal proponent of stolen election claims. She told NBC in July 2022 that as a volunteer for Lawyers for Trump during the 2020 election, she had established contact with people inside the Trump administration, as well as with associates of allies like Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s onetime lawyer and an alleged architect of the “fake elector” scheme to overturn the election results. She also said she had contact with Trump attorney Sidney Powell, another alleged “fake elector” conspirator. (Giuliani has denied contact or association with members of the Oath Keepers or Proud Boys and any wrongdoing in the fake electors scheme. Powell pleaded guilty to conspiring to interfere in the 2020 election last October.) SoRelle told NBC in 2022 she did not communicate directly with Trump, though that didn’t deter Rhodes from asking her to put him in touch with the 45th president. SoRelle denied connecting Rhodes to Trump directly, but she said she contacted Andrew Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani’s son, in November 2020, when Andrew was then a White House special assistant. Records unearthed after the FBI seized SoRelle’s phone confirmed this and showed that there was another attempt by SoRelle to contact someone with a White House phone number via text on Dec. 20, 2020. The text was ultimately undeliverable and was rerouted to the White House switchboard. Rhodes made SoRelle his point person in the days ahead of Jan. 6, and she co-signed two open letters that Rhodes addressed to Trump before the attack on the Capitol. One of the letters went public just days before Trump mentioned the upcoming “wild” rally; the other was issued just days after. Both called on Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act. For Rhodes, that meant he could rally to Trump’s side throngs of armed Oath Keepers and any others who wanted to keep him in power or block Congress from its duties that day. The second open letter, dated Dec. 23, 2020, stated that “many of us will have our mission-critical gear stowed nearby just outside D.C., and we will answer the call right then and there, if you call on us.” In fact, starting Jan. 4, 2021, a “quick reaction force” with guns and gear was set up at a Virginia hotel just over the Potomac River. There were so many firearms transported there by Oath Keepers that it stunned one Florida Oath Keeper, Terry Cumming. Cumming testified at the Oath Keepers sedition trial that he had not seen so many weapons in one place since he was in the military. SoRelle was arrested and indicted on four counts tied to Jan. 6: conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, obstruction of justice by tampering with records and a single misdemeanor charge of entering and remaining in a restricted area. A federal judge deemed her mentally incompetent to stand trial in 2023 but did not disclose her ailment. She was restored to competency in February and in August, she struck a plea deal, admitting she was guilty of telling Oath Keepers to delete incriminating text messages. From December 2020 to January 2021, SoRelle was regularly privy to discussions about possible bids to stop the election certification, prosecutors said. She was also present for a meeting in an underground garage in D.C. between Tarrio and Rhodes on the eve of the insurrection. What was ultimately discussed at that meeting is unknown. A documentary filmmaker who had been recording the Proud Boys for weeks, at Tarrio’s invitation, was told to leave once the extremist leaders started chatting. SoRelle also attended another meeting with Rhodes on Jan. 10, 2021. They met with Jason Alpers, co-founder of Allied Security Operations Group, a group responsible for spreading key false 2020 election claims through its Antrim Michigan Forensics report. (Antrim County prosecutor James Rossiter told The Washington Post in 2022 that Giuliani asked for the county’s voting machines so he could give them to Trump.) Alpers testified under oath that during the Jan. 10, 2021, meeting, SoRelle was heavily intoxicated and Rhodes was beside himself: Jan. 6 hadn’t worked out as hoped, so Rhodes wanted Alpers to pass Trump a message urging him to invoke the Insurrection Act before Biden was inaugurated. Texts the FBI extracted from SoRelle’s cell phone showed that 48 hours before this meeting with Alpers, Rhodes sent a message to an Oath Keepers leadership chat: “My cell is down. will be back up soon. Can’t be avoided for now. stand firm. don’t go off half-cocked. There’s still a chance Trump will act as commander-in-chief. I’m working with others to make that a reality.” Immediately after Jan. 6, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle flatly condemned Trump’s conduct. As days turned to weeks, that attitude shifted among the GOP: The same lawmakers who had once come out against Trump for inspiring violence or had condemned his response to the attack opted to acquit him of inciting an insurrection when faced with an impeachment vote. In May 2021, the House of Representatives passed legislation to create a commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The body, which would be styled after the 9/11 Commission, would be tasked with reviewing what happened on Jan. 6 and probing security and intelligence failures. Members would be obligated to produce a final report at the end of their probe. Despite enjoying bipartisan support in the House, Trump publicly called on House Republicans to tank the bill. Just 35 Republicans voted with House Democrats to form the commission. Then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy rejected the commission by claiming that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi had drawn up an unfair framework. He claimed the commission’s focus would be too narrow and that its work would be repetitive of existing options already available to lawmakers to investigate. McCarthy said the commission wasn’t truly bipartisan, and he was insistent that the group look into security failures more broadly, including a probe into the death of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Billy Evans, who had died that spring after a driver slammed into a barricade on the Capitol’s north side. In fact, the bill meant to evenly split the committee members. There would be five Democrats and five Republicans, including a Democratic chair and a Republican vice chair, that would reflect the makeup of the chamber at the time. All commission members would be imbued with subpoena powers subject to final approval by the committee chairs. When a measure to form the commission went to the Senate for a vote, only a week after the House passed its bill, Senate Republicans filibustered it. Only six Republicans joined Democrats in voting to form a body to investigate the worst attack on the Capitol in over a century. Then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to support the bill in the Senate and whipped members against it, even though he had once said Trump was “morally responsible” for Jan. 6. (McConnell also voted to acquit Trump of inciting an insurrection.) The Senate’s filibuster of a full commission left the House with no choice but to strike out on its own. Members drafted a new resolution that would require just a simple majority to form a select committee. A select committee wasn’t necessarily a downgrade, but was the last remaining tool to explore the attack through the legislative branch of government. In June 2021, the House voted to approve the creation of the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. The only two Republicans who aligned with Democrats on that vote were then-Reps. Liz Cheney (Wis.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.). The resolution to form the select committee featured slightly different terms: There would be 13 members instead of 10. Democrats extended an olive branch to Republicans and wrote into the committee rules that at least five members would need to be appointed in consultation with the House minority leader. McCarthy presented several nominees and Pelosi accepted some. She would not compromise, however, when McCarthy presented Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana. Both men voted to overturn Biden’s victory after Jan. 6, and Democrats believed they were too close to Trump to investigate impartially. This prompted McCarthy to take his ball and go home. Instead of finding just two more suitable candidates, he withdrew all five of his nominees and lashed out at Pelosi. To save the committee from falling to the wayside, Pelosi picked the only two Republicans she felt were left for the job: Kinzinger and Cheney. The Republican National Committee sued, claiming the select committee had been improperly formed because it didn’t have 13 members or a “ranking member.” The panel only ended up having nine members. With Cheney as vice chair, it was a rose by any other name, according to the Trump-appointed judge, U.S. District Judge Tim Kelly. Kelly ruled against the RNC, finding there was nothing illegitimate about how the committee had been formed or its final makeup. After all, Kelly noted, the House had previously formed committees with an imbalance of Republicans to Democrats, including a panel in 2005 that investigated the federal response to Hurricane Katrina. There were zero Democrats on that committee. Trump has railed against the committee for years and has called for its members to be jailed. His attacks on Liz Cheney for her participation as vice chair have been constant. Trump and lawmakers like Rep. Barry Loudermilk have accused her of tampering with witnesses who testified before the committee. The final report, released by the Jan. 6 committee in December 2022, detailed what its members, like Cheney, said showed an unprecedented effort to defraud the American people with “nonsense” allegations that were “designed to prey upon the patriotism of millions of men and women who love our country.” “Most Americans also did not know exactly how Donald Trump, along with a handful of others, planned to defeat the transfer of presidential power on January 6th. This was not a simple plan, but it was a corrupt one,” Cheney wrote in the foreword of the committee’s report. Trump was indicted on four felony charges for Jan. 6: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights. Special counsel Jack Smith, after showing evidence to a grand jury, secured an unprecedented indictment against a former president. The evidence was alleged to show how Trump engaged in a massive scheme to stop the transfer of power after he was defeated by Biden. Trump was accused of lying about voter fraud to further that conspiracy. While endlessly insisting that he had won, he tasked a coterie of his allies to pressure state officials or advance fake elector slates. When members of the Justice Department and the nation’s intelligence agencies told him repeatedly that there was no evidence of fraud, he kept up the scheme, according to prosecutors. And as his lawyers tried to advance claims of voter fraud in court, failing every time, Trump’s strategy of pressure and intimidation ramped up — until it exploded with his speech at the Ellipse on Jan. 6. Then, prosecutors claimed, Trump stood by for more than an hour as the Capitol was ransacked; lawmakers, staff and journalists fled for their lives; over 140 officers were assaulted; and deaths followed. Had Trump not won the election in November against Vice President Kamala Harris, there is no guarantee that he would have actually gone to trial, given the composition of a Supreme Court that has granted him vast immunity protections and his pattern of filing endless appeals, delays and motions to dismiss. In the end, however, and despite his attempts to rewrite the story of Jan. 6, Trump’s attempt to keep Smith’s charging report hidden from the annals of history failed. Smith, who resigned after the case was dismissed in light of Trump’s election, explained in his final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland why Trump was ultimately not charged with insurrection. And he argued, despite Trump’s claims otherwise, his prosecution was never a matter of politics. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "5 Ingredients Experts Say To Avoid In Store-Bought Salad Dressings",
    "text": "Salads are one of the first foods many people think of when they want to opt for a healthy meal. Unless you’re going for a chicken, tuna, egg or pasta salad, it’s a meal choice guaranteed to be full of veggies, which means you’ll be getting lots of fiber (an important nutrient the vast majority of people in the U.S. don’t get enough of) and other nutrients. But a salad without dressing can be, well, boring. Depending on the type of dressing you go with, how you top off your salad can either make it even more nutrient-rich or subtract from the benefits. That’s why it’s important to know which dressing ingredients can make your salad healthier and which ones to avoid. The first decision involved in choosing a salad dressing is figuring out if you want a creamy dressing or an oily one. In terms of nutrition, Bonnie Taub-Dix, a registered dietician and the author of ”Read It Before You Eat It: Taking You From Label To Table,” said creamy dressings tend to be higher in saturated fat than oily dressings, with the saturated fat coming from both oils and dairy. “These types of fats are not as healthy for us [as unsaturated fats], and the American Heart Association recommends that saturated fats make up less than 6% of one’s diet,” Taub-Dix said. While you may not think of creamy salad dressings as having oil, registered dietitian Melissa Rifkin says store-bought dressings often do, which can increase the amount of saturated fat. Still, this doesn’t automatically mean that an oily dressing is more nutritious than a creamy one. “The oil will determine the ratio of fats in the dressing and plays a significant role in how ‘healthy’ the dressing is,” Rifkin said. For example, olive oil has a higher amount of unsaturated fats (which, unlike saturated fats, are good for heart health) than vegetable oil, making it a healthier option. “Different oils have different nutrient components,” registered dietitian Alexis Newman said. “Dressings that have oils that are high in monounsaturated fat are recommended. These types of fats help reduce bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL), which prevents heart disease and reduces inflammation.” No matter what kind of salad dressing you’re eying, Taub-Dix said it’s a good idea to read the nutrition label, not only to check the saturated fat content, but also the sugar, sodium and calories if one of your health goals is weight loss. It’s worth it to read the ingredients list, too, and keep an eye out for five specific ingredients that the dietitians said have little or no nutritional value. Palm oil can pop up in both creamy and oily dressings, and it’s a top ingredient that Taub-Dix said to avoid. By now, you might have an inkling as to why. Yep, it’s high in saturated fat. “Dressings made with avocado oil or olive oil are healthier,” Taub-Dix said. You may not think of sugar as being used in salad dressings, but all three dietitians say it’s pretty common. “Often, fruity types of salad dressing, like a raspberry vinaigrette, will be higher in sugar content,” Taub-Dix said. Other popular salad dressings that use sugar include honey mustard, sweet Italian dressing, poppy seed and French dressing. Here’s what’s tricky about sugar in dressings. Taub-Dix said it’s often listed in the ingredients by other names. High-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, barley malt, dextrose, maltose and rice syrup are ways sugar can be listed. Tricky, right? In general, the American Heart Association says to keep added sugar intake under 6 teaspoons (or 24 grams) a day for women ,and 9 teaspoons (or 26 grams) a day for men. Eating a diet high in sugar is linked to a slew of health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some types of cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. While the amount of added sugar listed on the nutrition label may be quite low, Rifkin said it’s important to keep in mind that the amount of dressing you use on your salad may be more than a serving size. “A serving of dressing is generally considered to be two tablespoons, which is much less than what most people use,” Rifkin said. “The amount of sugar in a dressing becomes even more important when dressing is consumed in larger amounts.” “Salt is a common ingredient in all dressing and should be monitored by those who have high blood pressure,” Rifkin said. The reason for this is because salt contains sodium, and a diet high in sodium ups the risk for cardiovascular disease. According to one scientific study, the risk of cardiovascular disease increases up to 6% for every gram of sodium intake. The American Heart Association recommends capping sodium intake at 2,300 milligrams a day, which is about 1 teaspoon of salt. And if you already have high blood pressure, the daily recommended limit is even lower — 1,500 mg. Because salt is such a common ingredient, 90% of people in the U.S. consume more than this recommended amount, so it’s definitely something to be mindful of. Some types of salad dressings that are often high in sodium include Caesar, blue cheese and Thousand Island. Just like with sugar, Rifkin said the amount of salad dressing you may use is likely higher than what the nutrition label lists as a serving size. Rifkin explained that monosodium glutamate (MSG) is used in some salad dressings as a flavor enhancer. It’s made from fermented carb sources, such as sugar beets. It’s often used in salad dressing for its umami flavor, which is quite literally mouthwatering. Some scientific studies show that a diet high in MSG can cause inflammation in the body. Other studies have shown that consuming MSG regularly is linked to obesity and reproductive malfunctions, and that “further studies need to be undertaken in order to assess the connection between MSG and cardiovascular disorders, headache, and hypertension in human models.” Coconut oil may sound healthy, but Taux-Dix said it’s yet another ingredient that’s high in saturated fat, making it one to avoid. Just like with palm oil, she suggested skipping dressings with this oil. Go for ones with avocado oil or olive oil instead. Avoiding these common salad dressing ingredients will keep your greens from turning into a calorie-laden sodium bomb.

Log in to hide these messages. If you’re still looking for flavor enhancement, don’t underestimate the power of fresh herbs, such as garlic, basil or thyme, Taub-Dix said. Not only do they add flavor, but herbs are full of antioxidants, which are good for heart health. That’s certainly something the ingredients listed above can’t claim! Of course, enjoying your salad is important too, and most things in moderation are completely fine, Newman said. So, if you love a dressing that’s full of the ingredients listed here and isn’t technically “healthy,” that’s OK. Just keep that in mind and don’t fool yourself into thinking that your romaine covered in blue cheese dressing with extra bacon bits is going to be your healthiest meal. Some meals are simply for enjoyment, not nutrition. And that’s OK, too.

    "title": "5 Things To Know About The California Wildfires",
    "text": "The scourge of wildfires in Los Angeles and the surrounding area are the most destructive in the city’s history, and the city’s fire chief said the region was still in the midst of an “extreme weather event” as a new blaze quickly grew to 1,000 acres in mere hours Thursday. Here are five things to know as firefighters work to battle the flames. By itself, the Palisades Fire is already the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles history. The blaze has destroyed more than 5,300 structures — homes, businesses, RVs and other buildings — and flattened entire neighborhoods and stretches of oceanfront homes. But there are many other blazes scorching neighborhoods and hillsides across the region. Firefighters are battling four other major blazes, including the mammoth Eaton Fire near Pasadena. That blaze has destroyed as many as 5,000 structures, too. Strong winds and dire conditions have sparked other fires. The Kenneth Fire broke out in the Woodland Hills neighborhood on Thursday afternoon but quickly grew to nearly 1,000 acres in mere hours. In terms of human tragedy, at least 10 deaths have been linked to the fires, although officials have warned the death toll could rise. Firefighters have made progress battling some of the blazes. The Palisades Fire is 6% contained after scorching nearly 20,000 acres, and firefighters have made progress tackling two others, the Hurst Fire (37% contained) and the Lidia Fire (75%) contained. But heavy winds make battling the blazes difficult. Wind speeds fell on Thursday, giving firefighters a much-needed respite, but the latest forecasts show they could pick up again later this weekend into next week. With the blazes still burning, analysts say the fires are on track to be among the costliest in American history with economic losses between $50 billion to $150 billion. California’s insurance market is almost certain to face a reckoning as the full scope of losses comes into focus. Just last month the state allowed insurers to charge homeowners higher premiums to protect themselves after many began to limit the policies they offered amid the growing threat of environmental disasters. The decision came after State Farm ended coverage for about 72,000 homes there, including 70% of its policies in the Pacific Palisades. Homeowners are able to buy into a state-created plan, called FAIR, as a last resort, but those policies only cover basic property damage and have a $3 million limit, The Associated Press notes, which could pose issues due to the high value of California real estate. FAIR told the AP it expects to be able to cover the full claims from the fires. But the disaster could make traditional insurance options come with much higher premiums. President Joe Biden has promised the federal government will pay 100% of disaster response costs for the wildfires for the next six months, a period that extends beyond the end of his administration. But the president said he wasn’t certain his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, would continue to be so generous. “I’m not in a position to answer that question,” Biden said Thursday when asked if Trump would continue to support California, per Politico. “I pray to God they will.” Trump has leveraged the fires to attack some of his political opponents. The president-elect has called on California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to resign and broadly blasted Democrats for the response to the blazes. Experts have long said that climate change is a key driver in the risk and size of wildfires. A 2021 study found climate change was the main cause in an increase in fire weather.

    "title": "Adam Kinzinger Brutally Sums Up The 'Entire' Republican Party With Just 1 Acronym",
    "text": "Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) — a frequent Donald Trump critic after his 2020 election loss — revealed why it’s “interesting” that critics tag him with the “RINO” acronym, which stands for “Republican in name only.” “The reality is the entire Republican Party today is the RINO. They’re Republicans in name only,” said Kinzinger in an interview with Salon shared Saturday. “They hold the title to the Republican Party, a lot of them still think they’re holding a legacy, but that’s exactly right, it’s gone,” he continued. Kinzinger, the focus of a new documentary, “The Last Republican,” from “Hot Tub Time Machine” director Steve Pink, added that “what it means now to be a Republican” is that you’re “driven by anger” and division. “I think what they stand for is supporting culture war, rage, and one person, one personality, and that’s Donald Trump. Now, they’ll never admit it, but that’s the reality of it,” he said. Kinzinger, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over his role in the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, served on the House committee that investigated the insurrection. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s election and, in a speech at the Democratic National Convention, declared that he was “putting our country first.” In a separate interview with Forbes published Friday, Kinzinger said he’s built “new alliances” in recent years and has realized he’s “probably closer to a Democrat now because of how the Republican Party has changed.” “The Democrats are now the party that’s defending America’s role in the world, defending Ukraine, which I’m really passionate about,” said Kinzinger, who predicted that the GOP is “toast for a while” as “Trumpism” won’t “survive past these four years.” The former congressman, in his interview with Salon, said he thinks Trump is “already a lame duck,” before noting that his control over his base could pose a “concern” for Republicans when the president-elect’s second term ends. “If you think about George W. Bush toward the end of his second term, Republicans were falling away. That won’t happen with Trump,” Kinzinger said. “All those Republicans who should be falling away will still have to face reelection even though Donald Trump doesn’t,” he continued. Kinzinger added that he doesn’t think the GOP can be “saved in the near term,” but he hopes people don’t “give up on it.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Adrien Brody Addresses Infamous 'SNL' Clip And Rumors He Was Banned",
    "text": "Adrien Brody isn’t quite sure what to think about speculation that his notorious “Saturday Night Live” performance got him permanently banned from the sketch show. Brody hosted “SNL” only once, on May 10, 2003, but during his final task of introducing Jamaican musical guest Sean Paul, the actor appeared in fake dreadlocks — and spent a whopping 41 seconds announcing Paul in a Jamaican accent. “They were all literally agape from me pitching,” Brody told Vulture in a recent profile. The moment recently resurfaced on social media to shocked reactions, with some noting that Brody said, “kill a batty boy” — a slur in Jamaican Patois for gay or effeminate men — in his intro, which prompted rumors online that he was banned from “SNL” as a result. Brody hasn’t been back in 22 years, after all. But he told Vulture that “SNL” producers gave him the wig and watched him do the bit without objection during a prior dress rehearsal. Brody wagered that “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels was likely upset regardless. “I think Lorne wasn’t happy with me embellishing a bit, but they allowed me to,” he told Vulture. “I thought that was a safe space to do that, weirdly.” Brody delivered a nearly indecipherable intro for Paul that night. Dressed in a tank top, dreadlocks and a sweat armband, he fully committed to the bit, starting by sputtering a series of “ya mons” on air in a pseudo-Jamaican accent.

    "title": "This Air Purifier 'Eliminates Smoke Completely' In Reviewers' Homes. Today It's Under $100.",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. There’s no way around it: access to clean air is essential. If you’re in an area affected by dust, pollen or frequent wildfires, suffer from allergies, own a few dander-ridden pets or some combination of all of the above, you’ll definitely benefit from having an air purifier in your home. These devices can get rid of odors, absorb dust particles, rid the air of harmful smoke and much, much more. We found one that’s smartphone-compatible, cleans spaces up to 926 square feet and has a reviewer saying it “eliminates smoke completely” while it’s running at high speed. And right now, it’s on sale for 29% off, knocking its price down to under $100. This air purifier has an auto-function that detects when the air has pollutants and speeds its fans up accordingly to capture the dust, odors, particles like viruses and smoke, mold and more. It also catches airborne dander, helping relieve allergies for those sensitive to pets. You can manually set its fan speed to clear your space faster or pair it with its smartphone app for scheduling, air qualify monitoring and filter replacement (also sold on Amazon) reminders. Blueair claims this model cleans 83% faster and makes 50% less noise than earlier models of its air purifiers. It features a night mode to turn off its lights, just in case you’d like to put yours in the bedroom, plus it connects with your Wi-Fi so you can link it with Alexa for voice commands and schedules. Several reviewers say it’s super quiet and its auto-fuction works really well. “One morning my wife was cooking bacon,” explains a reviewer,” and the auto kicked in and ramped up to high to clear the air. Tells me the sensors really work and doing their best to keep your air clean.” “I love these things. I have this larger one and have bought 3 smaller ones. I love the wifi set up and I love the auto setting. Super quiet and then one morning my wife was cooking bacon and the auto kicked in and ramped up to high to clear the air. Tells me the sensors really work and doing their best to keep your air clean. Also gives you status of filter cleanliness and when to change and air quality throughout the day. I’ve got them spaced out in my two story home and very happy and pleased I got these. These combined with my electromagnetic air filters and blue light in my HVAC unit, I know I am doing their best I can to keep the air in my house clean. Loving it.” — Aubri  “This is my second Blueair purifier, although the first one of this model that I’ve bought. We use this purifier in our master bedroom, so the fact that it has a night mode that is silent and dimmed lights is important. The lowest speeds are completely silent and even the highest speed is fairly quiet (quieter than our non-Blueair purifier’s “quiet” mode). The app allows you to see the air quality in your room and control your device remotely. Setting up the device and app is extremely simple and clear. Make sure you follow the instructions for cleaning/replacing filters and Blueair devices will last a long time. We have the filter on permanent order so we don’t have to think about when to replace it. However, the app allows you to see the “life” left in your filter, which can vary based on your situation and use. This device has been very helpful during pollen season for allergy relief. Most of the time I leave it on “automatic” mode and that works perfectly fine for day or night. Blueair purifiers fit almost anywhere and you just forget they are there.” — M. Lewis  “I love this Swedish designed air cleaner because of the simplicity of the controls. Just tap the front round button on it to set it to low, medium, or high speed. The round button has a circular blue light on top of button, 1,2,or 3 light, depending on what speed you have it set at. When the internal filters need changing the lights turn red. The air enters the cleaner from all four sides and the very first filter it hits is the colored skirt around the bottom half of it. These skirts are like a fitted sheet for a bed, once in place they stay. You can also buy different colors, yellow, etc. to kind of match your room your putting it in. I bought two of these, one for my apartment, and one for my mother’s house. Both came with a black and a blue bottom skirt. I wash them in my washer when they get really dirty, you’ll know, colors fade as gray dust coats it. The filters are layered and molded in one piece, 4 sided, and easy to install. The top half of the air cleaner lifts off, drop the filter pack in, and your ready to go. You also lift the top half of air cleaner when you put a new skirt on the bottom half. The high speed is where I run my Blueair at all times, have neighbor in apartment next to me, and smoke seeps in. I eliminates the smoke completely when used on high speed. If you need to move the air cleaner you do have to lift it up from the bottom and carry it upright so that top doesn’t fall off. It not really that heavy to move and how often do you move an air cleaner around. Price on this model seems to go up and down often, so shop carefully. Also the filter pack replacement is on par with larger air cleaner, more than a small one, but really not over priced on Amazon. I think you’ll be pleased with this Blueair Blue 211.” — Airbus30b  “This thing is so quiet, too quiet? Is it even on? I replaced a large older unit in my bedroom and I cannot believe how quiet this is in comparison. You have to put your ear right up to it to hear it when it is on low.” — Trish  “Very happy with this filter. Ended up buying three more. The replacement filters are mildly expensive, but my seasonal allergies are a lot better, my house doesn’t have that Labrador smell, and the filters attract a ton of particulate. Been running every day for four years… mostly on low… I change my filters every six months. Consider getting replacement filters on auto ship as the subscribe and save deal is hard to beat price wise.” — Tommy By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "A.J. Brown Pulls Unusual Move On Bench During Game And Now We've Seen It All",
    "text": "Well, that’s one way to stay on the same page with teammates. Philadelphia Eagles receiver A.J. Brown was spotted reading a self-help book on the bench during a playoff game Sunday. Brown’s perusal of “Inner Excellence” by Jim Murphy caught the attention of the Fox broadcast team. Play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt surmised that Brown was “frustrated” with the few opportunities he had on Sunday (one reception for 10 yards). Analyst Tom Brady tried to give the unusual sight some humorous perspective. “I haven’t seen too many people read books, but I’ve seen a quarterback eat a hot dog,” he said, referring to a 2009 incident involving ex-New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez. \"I haven't seen too many people read books. But I've seen a quarterback eat a hot dog.\" - Tom Brady 🏈🎙️📚🌭 #NFL pic.twitter.com/t3KxDqCUXS After the Eagles had wrapped up their 22-10 home victory over Green Bay to advance to the divisional round, Brown read the room and answered a reporter’s questions about his book break. “It gives me a sense of peace. That’s a book I bring every single game,” he said. “My teammates call it a recipe. It’s the first time I heard that y’all got it on camera. It’s not the first game. It got a lot of points in there ... it’s a lot of mental parts about it.” He said he uses it as a “refresher every drive.” He conveyed similar sentiments on social media as well, adding that “people tend to create controversy when they don’t know the truth.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Contrary to what Burkhardt said, Brown said he felt good during the wild card matchup and was satisfied that he contributed in ways that didn’t show up on the stats sheet.

    "title": "No Survivors After Passenger Jet Crashes With Helicopter Near DC Airport: Officials",
    "text": "There are no survivors after a commercial flight and a military helicopter, carrying a total of 67 people, collided in midair Wednesday night as the jet was about to land at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., authorities said Thursday. At least 28 bodies have been pulled from the icy water of the Potomac River bordering the airport. These include the bodies of the three Army soldiers who were in the helicopter, officials told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. “Unfortunately we weren’t able to rescue anyone but we are in the recovery mode,” Jack Potter, the president and CEO of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said at a late morning press conference Thursday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the remains of both aircraft have been recovered. The passenger jet was found inverted and located in three different sections “in about waist-deep water.” The flight ― operated by PSA Airlines for American Airlines ― was en route from Wichita, Kansas, and was scheduled to land in the nation’s capital just before 9 p.m. local time. American Airlines confirmed there were 60 passengers and four crew members on board. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said the passenger jet collided with the helicopter “on an otherwise normal approach.” “At this time we don’t know why the military aircraft came into the path of the PSA aircraft,” Isom said Thursday. Video from the moment of the crash, taken from the nearby Kennedy Center, appears to show two aircraft, one large and one small, flying near each other before a bright fireball lights up the sky. An object appears to fall into the Potomac below. Webcam at the Kennedy Center caught an explosion mid-air across the Potomac. https://t.co/v75sxitpH6 pic.twitter.com/HInYdhBYs5 Staffing in the air traffic control tower was “not normal” at the time of the collision, and one air traffic controller was working two positions at the time of the crash, according to an FAA report obtained by the AP on Thursday. The AP also obtained audio of air traffic controllers warning the helicopter that a plane was incoming just 30 seconds before the crash. “PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ,” the controller said in a radio call, using identifiers for the helicopter and the jet respectively. The two aircraft collided moments later. The Army confirmed that a Black Hawk helicopter was involved in the crash. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the helicopter was operating out of Fort Belvoir in Virginia and was on “an annual proficiency training flight” at the time. “It was a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation,” Hegseth added. “They did have night-vision goggles.” Fox News previously reported no senior officials were aboard the helicopter. Hegseth earlier said the Army and the Pentagon have launched an investigation into the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board is also probing the accident. “We are going to get to the bottom of this investigation, not in three years, not in four years, but as quickly as possible,” Duffy said at an afternoon news conference. We’re aware of reports that American Eagle flight 5342, operated by PSA, with service from Wichita, Kansas (ICT) to Washington Reagan National Airport (DCA) has been involved in an incident. We will provide information as it becomes available. The NTSB said it expects to release a preliminary report on the crash in 30 days and a final report once investigators’ full work is complete. “We’re here to assure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned in this investigation,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at an afternoon news conference that outlined the agency’s investigation process. Homendy stressed that the board would not speculate on the cause of the crash. The flight data recorders had not been recovered from the water as of Thursday afternoon, “which is not unusual.” Information that has been gathered also needs time for review and verification, she said. Jim Brauchle, an attorney and former U.S. Air Force navigator, told HuffPost he will be looking out for the “human factors analysis” from the NTSB probe. “Based on the facts that we have now, it appears that it is a human error, and it could be a visual or perception error,” Brauchle said. President Donald Trump, speaking at an afternoon press conference, speculated that the past administration’s focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, in hiring could be to blame for the crash. “We do not know what led to this crash but we have some very strong opinions,” he said from the White House briefing room. Trump said the helicopter could have made “a million different maneuvers” before colliding with the plane, but “for some reason it kept going.” “All of this is going to be studied, but it just seems to me … some really bad things happened, and some things happened that shouldn’t have happened,” he said. Asked by a reporter about his claim that DEI could be linked, he responded, “It just could have been.” “You have to go by brain power, psychological quality,” Trump said of selecting qualified federal employees. “I can’t imagine people with 20/20 vision not seeing what’s happening up there.” Vice President JD Vance, in separate remarks from the press briefing, also hammered the need for putting diversity in hiring practices on the back burner. Air traffic control needs to have people who are “actually competent to do the job,” he said. Asked about Trump’s speculation that the crash is related to DEI, Homendy said that examining the people involved is a standard part of the NTSB’s practice. “We look at the human, the machine and the environment. So we will look at all of the humans that were involved in this accident,” she said. Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, told the AP that the crew flying the Army Blackhawk helicopter was “very experienced.” “Both pilots had flown this specific route before, at night. This wasn’t something new to either one of them,” Koziol said. “Even the crew chief in the back has been in the unit for a very long time, very familiar with the area, very familiar with the routing structure.” Brauchle explained that it is possible that the helicopter could have mistaken an entirely different aircraft for the passenger jet. “It’s very easy to pick up on the wrong thing,” Brauchle told HuffPost. “And you may see a flashing light or a tower and say, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s an aircraft.’ And you start focusing on that, and then you miss the actual airplane.” The president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a labor union representing aviation safety professionals, stressed Thursday that it “would be premature to speculate on the root cause of this accident.” “America’s highly trained and skilled air traffic controllers all do amazing work every day keeping the nation’s passengers and cargo moving safely and efficiently to their destinations,” said NATCA President Nick Daniels in a statement. “This job is more than a profession; it’s a responsibility we hold deeply, and when tragedy strikes, it stays with us.” U.S. Figure Skating said several members of its community, including “athletes, coaches, and family members” were aboard the passenger jet. “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts,” the organization said in a statement to HuffPost. Former world champions and ice skating coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov of Russia were said to be on that flight, Reuters reported, citing Russian state media. Trump, earlier in the morning, said he was monitoring the situation and would provide more details as they arose. “I have been fully briefed on the terrible accident which just took place at Reagan National Airport,” the president said in a statement. “May God Bless their souls. Thank you for the incredible work being done by our first responders.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the crash was “a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented.” Duffy said the information he’s seen so far appears to confirm Trump’s assessment that the accident could have been avoided. “Do I think this was preventable? Absolutely,” Duffy said. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said he had flown the direct route between Wichita and the Capitol “many times” since it launched around a year ago. “It is certainly true that in Kansas and in Wichita in particular, we’re going to know people who were on this flight,” Moran said during a news conference. “So this is a very personal circumstance.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "A recent episode “Watch What Happens Live” took an unexpected turn that no one — least of all Andy Cohen — bargained for. The host enlisted his SiriusXM radio co-host John Hill to help him lean into that “new year, new me vibe,” by counting down a list of “Things Andy Should Do in 2025.” Before Hill, Cohen’s ex, uttered his first words, Cohen admitted he was sweating in nervous anticipation of what he might say. And Hill didn’t disappoint. Hill began with a couple off-the-wall suggestions (that Cohen get “tits” and “learn to read”). And for his third resolution, Hill said that Cohen should “release their sex tape” from 2003. At this point, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Jayne, another guest on the show that day, chimed in, saying, “Wait, I kinda wanna see it.” A stunned Cohen, playing along, admitted, “I think there is one,” but that the tape is so old that it might be in too “janky” a format to watch.

    "text": "Anthony Scaramucci said he “really likes” the Taylor Swift song “Cassandra” during a comedic interview posted to TikTok on Tuesday. Scaramucci, who was former President Donald Trump’s communications director for 10 days in 2017, was discussing karma with Zoe Larkin, a Yale graduate who conducted the interview, when she asked him if he related to Swift’s song “Karma.” Scaramucci wasn’t familiar with it even after Larkin sang a snippet, but it led him to reveal that he “really” likes the song “Cassandra” by Swift. “The goddesses said to Cassandra, ‘You will have clairvoyance, you will be able to see the future, but you’ll also be cursed with that no one will believe you,’” Scaramucci said. He went on to explain that Cassandra, a princess in Greek mythology who was cursed to have her prophecies go unheard, went to her father to tell him that thousands of ships were coming to destroy their city. Larkin interrupted Scaramucci to tell him about her own prophecy. “That’s sort of like when I told everyone that skinny jeans would come back and they didn’t believe me,” Larkin said. “Right,” Scaramucci said. “People don’t like the truth, see?” He continued: “What Homer was trying to teach, through the fictional character of Cassandra, is that none of us like the truth.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "10 'Worth Every Penny' Shower Products For Folks With Limited Mobility",
    "text": "For folks with limited mobility, day-to-day activities and tasks can take more effort and pose increased risk. Showering, in particular, can be challenging and even downright scary. Getting in and out of the tub and moving around in the shower presents the possibility of slipping or falling because of wet surfaces. We’ve found some reviewer-beloved products from Amazon that folks swear by for preventing injuries while bathing. Many people say these items changed and saved their lives, and some even deemed a product the “Cadillac” of shower assisters! Read on for some of their favorite picks. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. This Gorilla Grip bath mat is carefully designed for safety against slipping, with hundreds of heavy suction cups that grip your shower floor; soft, textured material to help you stay balanced and drainage holes to prevent water from pooling up. It's BPA-free and machine-washable, so you can just toss it in the washer when it needs a clean. This is designed for use on smooth surfaces; its suction is not effective on tiled or uneven floors. It's available in 20 colors. Promising review: \"I first purchased this mat 4 years ago based on its great reviews and I couldn't agree more with them! It stays put and gives a lot of traction in the shower while still looking aesthetically pleasing. It's lasted through years of continuous use in both a stand alone shower and shower/tub combo. I first bought it after getting an injury slipping in the shower and my doctor recommended getting a shower mat. It's super easy to keep clean- just throw it in the washer to refresh it- no scrubbing needed! Perfect for a mobility-impaired person like me, or anyone with a slippery shower/tub. It lasted 4 years (!!!) before needing to replace it (because the suction cups had finally worn out). $25-30 every 4-ish years is well spent for increased safety and security!\" — Cassandra This aluminum shower chair from Medline helps make bathing easier and safer while offering a safeguard against slipping. You're able to sit while you wash yourself, and its backrest and padded armrests make cleansing more comfortable and supportive than its shower stool counterparts. It's thoughtfully designed, too, with drain holes that allow water to pass through, non-slip feet and height-adjustable legs. Plus, it promises a tool-free assembly. It can accommodate up to 350 pounds and is designed to fit in most bathrooms. You can adjust its height in 1-inch increments ranging from 16 to 21 inches. Promising reviews: \"I have a bad knee. Too many high school sports, and physical jobs in my younger years. What scares me the most is falling in the shower. Yes, it might sound like a hippo falling down the stairs to the basement, but in reality it does hurt when I lay there in pain afterwords. This nifty little chair allows you to sit and relax while taking your shower. It has holes in the seats so water can pass through, so puddles don't collect. It is also nice of it's sturdy build. Just get one. Instead of being 'too proud' and risking it, take control of your safety and life.\" — Rob \"Elderly parents moved in. Adjustable height for tall dad, small mom. Ultra light mobility, yet sturdy. Easy to clean. We got a second after we saw how good this was. One for in shower, one for after shower landing to help get dressed (placed towel over after shower landing).\" — Gilbert Lopez Reviewers with limited mobility or whose loved ones have difficulty getting in and out of the shower call this a \"godsend.\" The bench helps folks enter and exit showers and tubs while in a safe seated position, with the aid of the chair's extended seat, backrest and arm handle. It has strong, non-slip suctioning on its feet to keep it secure, adjustable legs to best fit your height and tool-free assembly. Plus, it's easily reversible for left or right side entry. Promising reviews: \"I got this for my elderly parents when I learned with dismay that they had been too scared to take showers and were doing sponge baths. Stepping over the edge of the tub was one of the biggest hurdles, and I thought 'do we need to get one of those tubs with the side cut out?' I was actually thinking we needed to remodel their bathroom. NO. Someone who worked with elderly told me about the chairs that go over the side of the tub, so that someone can sit down outside the tub, and then scoot over on the bench to get into the tub. I found this one and reading so many positive reviews ordered it. I put it together in about 10 minutes following the directions - it's super easy. No screws needed - everything just snaps into place. One of my parents is a larger person probably 250 pounds and this handles their weight just fine. Now they're taking showers all the time. After a few uses, my father said 'this is the best thing you've ever bought for me.'\" — lisa marie \"This transfer bench is a life saver. Purchase for wife after back surgery. Made life a lot easier.\" — Mr. J For those seeking extra security and ease, this professional-grade carousel shower chair is an excellent option: Multiple reviewers are calling it \"the Cadillac of shower chairs.\" Its seat can swivel 360 degrees and move from end to end of the bench with the push of a button, and users can raise, lower and lock the armrests for added support, too. It's padded all over for extra comfort and you can adjust the legs for added height. It's available in two colors and in a version with added slide length. Promising review: \"This transfer bench is amazing. It has made showering my elderly mom so much safer that I don't worry about accidents any more. She really likes it. Showers are not stressful any more. Very easy to assemble and use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a truly safe way to get in and out of the shower.\" — Placeholder \"This shower chair is beyond what I hoped for. I have actually used it and for the first time in a very long time I felt completely safe showering. The pivoting function is so important. The chair glides easily over my tub Into position. I could pull the shower curtain along the side and no water got on the floor. It is a little more than I wanted to spend, but it turns out very much worth every penny. Now I look forward to my showers.\" — Kim Ham We've previously covered this ingenious \"shower doodad\" that enables you to give your feet a good scrubbing without bending over to reach them. The mat measures a little over nine inches and features 126 suction cups to keep it firmly embedded to the base of your tub. Promising review: \"This mat is super easy to use! Feels good to your feet and the suggestion to just squirt body wash on the mat and rub your feet on the mat! Since having hip replacement this has been very helpful!\" — Glenna This stainless steel safety handle clamps onto the side of the tub, making it easier and safer to step into and out of the shower. It's heavy-duty, able to support up to 300 pounds, while requiring no tools for assembly — only the securing of its clamp. It's available in two colors and in a version with a height-adjustable handle. Promising reviews: \"Perfect product for my elderly Mom as she visited our home. Easily installed ( essentially out-if-the-package ready), cushioned to avoid damaging my tub and extremely stable. Worth every penny to keep your loved ones safe as they enter and exit the tub. I was able to position it so it was also used as a grab bar when using the potty\" — Katydid6400 \"This hold on has been so wonderful for bathroom challenges after hip replacement. It stays in place well and has made my life so much easier.\" — Marie Dendy Reviewers are singing the praises of this assistive grab pole, which you can use for stability while exiting the shower (or getting off the toilet or out of bed). It has multiple handrails, which can rotate 360 degrees and lock every 90 degrees so you can safely grab them from multiple angles. It requires no drilling to use, and can fit flat ceilings from 7 to 10 feet. It's designed to support up to 300 pounds. It's available in two colors. Promising review: \"This pole is one of the best purchases I have made in my life. Recently, my elderly mother has had increasing trouble getting into the shower and getting up from the toilet because of creaky arthritic knees. I bought this pole around a year ago and put it in the bathroom. What a huge difference it makes. I recently bought a second one to place in another location in the bathroom, and I'm thinking of getting more for the bedroom and another room. It's sturdy and steady and really does the trick. I love it and can't recommend it highly enough.\" — Jane Doe \"My Dad is 91 and remains living at home but needs assistance getting up from a sitting position and extra stability while standing to get dressed and out from shower. I purchased one to assist getting out of bed, then three additional, one for toilet, one for dressing chair and one for outside shower door. Best product out there. Thank you and congratulations to the family who designed this for their Grandma. I never review products but this is a life saver and I want to share with others in this situation, like me and my Dad.\" — Marcia Lucey Make showering easier with this handheld shower head, whose 69-inch hose gives you ample room for maneuvering — and the ability to target hard-to-reach places — without having to take any steps. You can even enjoy hold and use the shower head while sitting down. This pick also includes a sturdy grab bar for extra safety that can support up to 250 pounds of weight. The shower head has five different spray options and is available in four finishes. Promising reviews: \"We are both 81 years old and this has made a major difference in the height of the shower head, the ease of use, especially while sitting on a shower stool, and the most important thing...our sense of safety getting in and out and in using the shower. Small investment, great benefit!\" — George N. \"This is a great safety feature for my husband's balance issues. It is right where it needs to be for him to grab exiting shower. I highly recommend this product for any one with balance issues.\" — Maggie c Folks rave about this suctioned shower head holder, which can hold your handheld hose at a more comfortable height for easy access while you're seated in a shower chair. Promising review: \"This is an ideal product for folks with limited shoulder mobility--eliminate a long reach to get /replace the shower head. Easy to install, and adheres well.\" — Arlene F. Reach difficult-to-clean areas of your body without having to move around with this lightweight, lengthy brush which stretches 15.2 inches long. It has bristles on one side for scrubbing and a loofah on the other for gentle exfoliation. You can also use the bristled side for dry brushing. It includes a hanging loop and cut-out hole design so you can easily hang it up after use. Promising reviews: \"I love this long handled shower body brush with Loofah and back scrubber! I ordered this because I had a full knee replacement, and it worked great to use in the shower. It is just the right size and length, and I will keep using it even after recovery. The Loofah is lush and soft, and the brush is not harsh and is great to reach your back. I also really like the loop to hang it up to dry afterwards.\" — Nana \"Got this for my elderly mother.

    "title": "Man Convicted Of Raping And Drugging Wife Linked To Other Crimes",
    "text": "NANTERRE, France (AP) — Dominique Pélicot, the convicted rapist who horrified France by drugging his then wife so other men could rape her, was questioned Thursday about other cases of rape and murder that he’s suspected in. Pélicot is serving a 20-year prison term after he was found guilty in December for the horrific sexual abuse of his now ex-wife, Gisèle Pélicot. His lawyer told The Associated Press that he now faces renewed questioning by an investigating magistrate who specializes in so-called cold cases — those that have proved particularly hard to resolve. The rape and murder cases date back to the 1990s. One involves Sophie Narme, a property agent who was killed in Paris on Dec. 4, 1991. His lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, said Dominique Pélicot denies any involvement in the killing. The other is the attempted armed rape of another property agent in the Paris suburb of Villeparisis on May 11, 1999. In that case, Pélicot acknowledges that he met the woman and tried to undress her but denies attempted rape, his lawyer said. Dominique Pélicot has been under formal investigation for both of those crimes since October 2022 — a legal status meaning that investigators believe there is an accumulation of serious evidence against him. Victims’ lawyer says cases tied in multiple ways Lawyer Florence Rault, who represents Narme’s family and the woman subjected to the rape attempt, said an array of similarities between the 1991 and 1999 cases suggested the perpetrator might be the same. “One has to remain cautious. Perhaps someone else committed the crime on Sophie Narme. But there are such similarities in the mode of operation, in the way the victims were approached — and the victims are so identical, too — that one can legitimately ask many questions,” Rault said on RTL radio. The two cases were grouped together into one investigation in September 2022 that was taken over by the specialized unit for cold cases and serial crimes. It works out of the Paris suburb of Nanterre. Pélicot’s lawyer says the cases are different Speaking on her way into Dominique Pélicot’s hearing with the investigating magistrate at the Nanterre cold-case unit, Zavarro said her client plans to cooperate. She noted that he had previously been questioned in 2023 and had acknowledged having been in contact with the property agent in the 1999 case, but not with Narme. “He has always said that he never met Sophie Narme,″ Zavarro said, adding that Dominique Pélicot has acknowledged to investigators that he met the other property agent. The lawyer said police found traces of his DNA at the scene of their meeting. “He acknowledged having had an altercation with her, having tried to undress her, but with intentions different from attempted rape,” she said. Pélicot’s lawyer sought to separate the current investigation from the abuse he inflicted on his then-wife. “Let’s remember ... he benefits from the presumption of innocence,” Zavarro said. “Let’s not make him into a guilty party ahead of time.” She described his conditions in solitary confinement, and said he has not been allowed visitors since 2020. “It’s an isolation measure that was imposed on him, and that he lives with every day. He is not complaining — he knows it was imposed on him based on the nature of the facts.” Cases predate drugging and rape of former wife Pélicot, 72, could spend the rest of his life behind bars. He won’t be eligible to request early release until he’s served at least two-thirds of his 20-year sentence, which was the maximum possible for the rapes and other crimes he was convicted of. The rape and murder cases occurred more than 10 years before the drugging and rapes of Gisèle Pélicot for which Pélicot and 50 other men were convicted — a nearly decade-long stretch of sexual abuse from 2011. He knocked her unconscious by lacing her food and drink with drugs and invited other men he met online to rape her. Gisèle Pelicot became a hero to many in France and beyond for courageously demanding that the men’s trial be held in open court.

    "title": "Apple To Pay $95 Million To Settle Suit Accusing Siri Of Snoopy Eavesdropping",
    "text": "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices. The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade. The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn’t seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, “Hey, Siri.” Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted. The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple’s long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers — a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve “a fundamental human right.” Apple isn’t acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms. If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents. Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices. The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It’s also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.

HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. If you’ve spent some time here at HuffPost Shopping, you might have noticed we have a thing for electric toothbrushes. Our readers can’t get enough of them, from the ones with built-in water flossers to the super-luxe ones with triple digit prices. But what if we told you you could get an electric toothbrush so good that reviewers are writing multi-paragraph odes in its honor... for only $30 right now, since it’s 25% off? The “powerful and effective” AquaSonic Black Series Ultra Whitening Toothbrush has over 91,000 5-star ratings on Amazon, and for good reason. Complete with a 40,000 VPM (vibrations per minute) motor, four brushing modes, smart vibration timers and a two-minute auto shutoff, the toothbrush is approved by the American Dental Association for its excellent plaque removal skills. It’s also well-designed, both waterproof and with an ergonomic handle. With proper, regular use, AquaSonic claims that the toothbrush can help whiten your teeth in as little as two weeks, and it comes with eight replacement brush heads, which can last you up to two and a half years. Two years of whiter teeth for $30? Say less. In addition to the toothbrush and eight replacement heads, you also get a travel case so you can take your new best friend with you on the go. You can charge the toothbrush wirelessly, but won’t have to do it very often, since the battery can last up to four weeks on a single charge. “I felt like I had just left my dentist’s office after a full session of ultrasonic plaque removal, gum stimulation and tooth polishing,” one reviewer wrote. “The feeling, as my tongue probed every millimeter of my teeth and gums, was one of sheer joy.” Another said, “I can’t believe the difference this has made in my appearance and in my confidence. I used to be nervous about speaking because of my teeth.” Yet another wrote, “Just be prepared for questions like, ‘Why are you smiling so much after brushing?’—because this brush and I have a bond now.” Below, find even more reviews about the AquaSonic toothbrush some shoppers say changed their lives. Or, just go ahead and add it to your cart, because a $30 deal for this kind of quality doesn’t come around often. “This is hands-down the best toothbrush I have ever used!!! The battery lasts a long time. It comes with several heads, it cleans thoroughly with multiple settings, it comes with a carrying case and a cover, and it is super easy to use! It takes less time to clean my teeth and my mouth gets so much cleaner compared to any other toothbrush I’ve ever used! The bristles are gentle on the gums. The two minute timer helps to assure I’m taking adequate time to clean my mouth, and it leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean. I have no complaints.” — Mattelyn “The world is a better place with this in it. I am so thankful that my kids can grow up in a world with a toothbrush so luxurious as this. If this existed 50 years ago root canals would not exist today. Maybe that last line is too grandiose a claim, but not by much.It’s soft, so soft, but oh so thorough.I have a Phillips-Sonicare but frankly I hate it. I hate it so much I hated brushing my teeth. I’m a former dental assistant (decades ago before college) and seeing the results of people neglecting their teeth still haunts me. I am related to and/or friends with a half dozen or more dentists. I know how important dental hygiene is. Yet I hated all my toothbrushes until I found this 9th wonder of the world. My teeth feel like I just left the dentist office. Truth be told, I had a cleaning 4 days ago but still, the results after 1 use are amazing. Add to that the multiple heads, the price, and the low noise level (it didn’t wake up light sleepers who were only feet away from me tonight when I first brushed my teeth ). I love this so much I’m pretty sure I’m going to become that weird old aunt who gives her 9 yr old nephew a toothbrush for his birthday.” — mom “this toothbrush is WORTH THE PRICE. first off, 2 years worth of heads? amazing. not even expensive sets do that. but the clean?? the different functions on the toothbrush are amazing. and no matter what i select my teeth feel like i just left the dentist. i have seriously never had an electric toothbrush like this.” — Amazon Customer “I bought this toothbrush in October of 2020, back when it was only $26. To be honest, I didn’t hold out a lot of hope that it would be great - but boy, was I mistaken! Years later, it’s still going strong. I do forget to charge it for weeks on end (so that may actually help it, since ‘battery conditioning’ is a thing, from what I’ve been told - too frequent charging of batteries can actually damage them) and it has never run out power. Replacement heads are inexpensive (just ordered a set of 10 for $9.99). Even at the $39 current price, I think this toothbrush is a good deal. I remember being surprised at how clean my teeth felt after using it the first time, and that was coming from long-time use of the ‘brand’ name toothbrushes we had. I know the Sonicare and Phillips that we used to use are way more expensive, and would have thought they’d do better than this one... but no!” — Reads 2 Much By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "Aubrey Plaza appears to have deleted her Instagram account in the wake of her husband Jeff Baena’s death. While the “White Lotus” actor’s account was previously active several days ago, a message on Plaza’s page now reads, “Sorry, this page isn’t available. The link you followed may be broken, or the page may have been removed.” Earlier this month, Baena, a writer and director, died by suicide at age 47 on Jan. 3, according to records from the Los Angeles County medical examiner. Plaza and Baena have been linked together since 2011. In 2021, the “Parks and Recreation” star revealed that the pair had tied the knot in an Instagram post. Over the years, Plaza has starred in multiple films directed by Baena, including 2014’s “Life After Beth,” 2017’s “The Little Hours” and 2022’s “Spin Me Round.” Last week, Plaza addressed Baena’s death in a joint statement with his family on Jan. 6. “This is an unimaginable tragedy. We are deeply grateful to everyone who has offered support,” the statement read. “Please respect our privacy during this time.” While appearing on the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” in December 2021, she recalled how she and Baena decided to get married.

    "title": "Tech Stocks Tank As Chinese Competitor Threatens To Upend The AI Frenzy",
    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s superstars tumbled Monday as a competitor from China threatens to upend the artificial-intelligence frenzy they’ve been feasting on. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, and they pulled the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% for its worst loss in more than a month. The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289 points, or 0.7%, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes. The shock to financial markets came from China, where a company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. Skepticism, though, remains about how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that’s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. DeepSeek’s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide. In Amsterdam, Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML slid 7%. In Tokyo, Japan’s Softbank Group Corp. lost 8.3% to pull closer to where it was before leaping on an announcement trumpeted by the White House that it was joining a partnership to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure. And on Wall Street, Constellation Energy lost more than a fifth of its value, 20.8%. The company has said it would restart the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to supply power for data centers for Microsoft. All the worries sent investors toward bonds, which can be safer investments than any stock. The rush pushed the yield of the 10-year Treasury down to 4.52% from 4.62% late Friday. It’s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast. Before Monday’s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia’s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example. It was just on Friday that Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg was saying he expects his company to invest up to $65 billion this year and grow its AI teams significantly, while talking up a data center in Louisiana that will be so large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan. A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. That’s why many 401(k) holders felt the pain of Nvidia’s drop, even if they didn’t know they owned any Nvidia, so long as they owned a fund that tracks the S&P 500. All told, the S&P 500 fell 88.96 points to 6,012.28. The Nasdaq composite dropped 612.47 to 19,341.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 to 44,713.58. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, suggested not overreacting to Monday’s sharp swings. “It is possible that the news out of China could be overstated and then we could see a reversal of the recent market moves,” Jacobsen said. “It is also possible that the news is true, but then that would present new investment opportunities.” More big swings may be ahead. Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla are all on the schedule this upcoming week to report how much profit they made at the end of 2024. The pressure is on companies to keep delivering strong profits, particularly after a recent jump in Treasury yields. When bonds are paying more in interest, they put downward pressure on stock prices. Yields have been on the rise amid a solid U.S. economy and worries about possibly higher inflation coming from tariffs and other policies favored by President Donald Trump. So far, big U.S. companies have been reporting better results than analysts expected. AT&T became the latest on Monday, and its stock rose 6.3%. In stock markets abroad, movements for broad indexes across Europe and Asia weren’t as forceful as for the big U.S. tech stocks. Stocks edged 0.1% lower in Shanghai after a survey of manufacturers showed export orders in China dropping to a five-month low. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

    "title": "The Best All-Purpose Facial Cleansers, According To Experts",
    "text": "Most of us can agree that washing your face is a vital step in a daily skin care routine. This instinct is supported by dermatologists and other skin experts claim that cleansing is necessary for not just removing dirt and grime from the surface of the face but also toxins and dead skin cells. These all act as impurities and potential barriers that can make it more difficult for your skin care products to penetrate if not cleared. “When it comes to facial cleansers, it is important to note that different cleansers may be better suited for different skin types,” said Dr. Marisa Garshick, a board-certified dermatologist with MDCS Dermatology in New York City. Therefore, we felt it important to track down the very best facial cleansers for all skin types, budgets and areas of concern using past and present guidance from trusted authorities in skin like Garshick and others.

    "text": "Somehow, overnight, bodysuits became a wardrobe essential for a variety of reasons. They can act as a compressive undergarment that makes everything look smooth and seamless under your closest-fitting clothing.

It’s true that Kim Kardashian’s intimates and loungewear brand Skims has dominated the bodysuit market and their designs are beloved by many, including our very own editors. But just in case you’re not a fan of the Skims price point or maybe the material isn’t supportive enough for your needs, we were curious about other bodysuit brand options out there that passed muster with our editors and reviewers alike. Stay tuned for the upcoming list of incredibly flattering suits that might not bear the Skims name but look and feel incredible, according to reviews.

    "text": "They say the eyes are the window to the soul, so it makes sense you want them to look as bright and defined as you can. Yet, if you have more mature skin, you may find some brands of eyeliner get smudgy or dry as you apply them. There are a lot of options on the market that reviewers in their 50s, 60s and beyond swear by. From pencils to pots, we rounded up a wide selection of eyeliners used and loved by reviewers with more mature skin. We gave you drug store options and luxury items alike — all of which come with glowing reviews from makeup wearers who have aged like fine wine. While many come in softer shades of brown or gray, we found a bunch of pure black options, as well. We hope you snag a new holy grail favorite or test out a few options to build out your makeup collection with products that work for you. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. An all-around classic, the MAC Colour Excess gel pencil is an ultra-pigmented, long-wear waterproof liner with a precise applicator that's easy to use. The gel-like product easily floats over skin and the smudge-resistant formula keeps your lines sharp and straight. Promising reviews: “1. Super smooth glide makes this easy to use, even on more delicate, older or crepe-y skin. It does not pull or tug the way some eyeliners will. Note: this equals you going through the product at a faster rate. But I find that you waste other products trying to get hard liners to soften up enough to work well on older eyes... Even if I don't wear mascara, this gives my eyes a very enhancing finish--sort of like mock lashes.” — JanieH (This review has been edited for length.)\"This liner is great for staying put, not pulling on my older skin, and looking fantastic!\" — Angela Creamy and pigmented, this retractable eyeliner is waterproof and will last for the day. It comes in a streamlined package that is easy to put on and will ensure you get the product exactly where you want it and not anywhere you don't. Promising reviews: \"All of ELF's products are great, but this eyeliner is the best I've ever used, and I'm 50 so I have used a lot of eyeliners.\" — Lara Beth“Love it. I am an older woman, most pencil liners pull my skin and don't produce a good continuous line. This pencil glides on and STAYS out all day long!!!!” — Kindle Customer With the glide of a liquid formula with the ease and precision of a stick, this twisting retractable pen is creamy and long-lasting. Heat and humidity-proof, it won't bleed as you're wearing it, giving you definition for hours on end. Promising review: \"The color is soft and rich. It glides on smoothly. I'm 70 years old but it's easy to control the fine tip. The color is beautiful for an older woman. I highly recommend this color and this pencil.\" — LB\"I have been wearing eyeliner since I was a teenager and I can say with 100% confidence that this is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used. I'm a pencil girl so I can't speak much about liquid. But this goes on really nice and doesn't pull or tear at my aging skin. It lasts all day under normal conditions and has stayed on for hours in the water. Love the bronze color with the tiny sparkles. It's the only liner ibhave purchased in several years now. And the price... FAHGEDABOUDIT! 5 STARS across the board.\" — Vanessa L. Knight Bring out that dazzle in your eyes with this olive-hued pencil liner. It's a rich, saturated formula that's silky to put on the skin but, according to reviewers, won't migrate as you wear it. The pencil shape is easy to use, ensuring you're getting the product right where you want it. Promising reviews: \"First, let me say that I have dry mature skin and have changed to only one neutral eye shadow to keep it simple, so the right color eyeliner really makes a difference with my hazel eyes. I just purchased the Forest Green color and I have to say that it does indeed glide on easily. I tightline the liner on my eyes (nothing on the bottom) and it works beautifully--really makes my eyes pop and my lashes look thicker, along with mascara of course. The liner does not cause any problems with my eyes, which seem to be more sensitive now, perhaps allergies are coming back. Seems the reviews like some of the other colors also, so I will be purchasing a couple of others in the future.\" — PoseyMom\"This is a superb beautiful product. Excellent for the older eye! does not pull, stays on all day, no smudging and retains the colour. Love it. My eye pencil for life. Thank you xx\" — Mermaidy For something new but still familiar, this eyeliner pencil has gel-like formula with a little metallic shimmer. It's made with a special wax blend that’s designed to easily slide over your eyelid so you don't have to pull or fuss and will last for over ten hours of wear. Promising review: \"I am in love with the Julep When Pencil met gel eyeliner pencils. I have used them daily for several years. I added the Golden Olive shimmer to my collection. I am 65 with blonde hair, hazel eyes, and medium skin tone. These are so easy to use on mature eyes. I find they sharpen best if you have the Julep pencil sharpener. They are sweatproof, waterproof and stay on until you take them off. You will need an eye makeup remover for waterproof eye makeup. I use the Julep oil cleanser to remove all my makeup. I love the cleansing oil too. I have very sensitive skin and eyes and both the eye pencil and cleansing oil do not irritate my eyes or skin. I love it and highly recommend.\" — Design Diva\"The product is so soft and easy to apply to the eyelid. I love the forgiving line that meshes into a shadow. I want to accentuate my eyes but at age 71, I cannot wear make-up that is too dark or harsh. The colors Golden Olive Shimmer and Smokey Taupe Shimmer are perfect colors for my greying hair, hazel eyes, and winter skin. The shimmer is not metallic so it is fine for an older skin. I love these eyeliners and I have bought the sharpener and two more colors. This product has not yet hurt my sensitive eyes and it seems to last all day.\" — Claudine Crafted from macadamia seed oil, shea butter and vitamin E, this mineral-based eyeliner has a soft formula that conditions your skin as you wear it. The pencil applicator makes it a breeze to put on and the soft formal won't pull or drag as you apply it. Promising reviews: \"I am middle aged and have been using Jane Iredale products for a few years. This is the first eye liner I have tried in years. It's perfect! Easy to use and beautiful.\" — Tawney\"Love how easily this fills in my eyebrows. The color is perfect.\" — Amazon customer As the brand says, this is essentially a long-wearing gel eyeliner that comes in pencil form. The application top ensures you're getting a straight and direct line and the built-in sponge at the bottom helps you achieve a more smoky look. Promising reviews: \"Perfection for the older eyelid and my favorite eye pencil. I've tried many top brands over the yrs; this one suits my needs the best. It's super pigmented and soft, which I need for an older eyelid.\" — Snackintire\"I ordered this eyeliner pencil a few months ago. I’m getting older, and applying my normal brown or navy eyeliner above the lashes wasn’t looking so great anymore. I use this as directed, pressing the color into the base of my lashes near the water line. It really is highly pigmented and it stays put all day. It helps define my eyes, as well as helping the look brighter and more awake. Highly recommend!\" — TPGreen Another drug store classic that has earned plenty of praise, the Revlon Colorstay eyeliner has a built-in sharpener and smuger at the bottom to make your life even easier. It's waterproof, creamy, easily drapes over your skin and lasts for up to 24 hours. Promising review: \"I’m old and have crepey skin everywhere including around my eyes. I needed a soft pencil as powder shadows were irritating my eyes. This pencil does the trick. It’s not smudge proof or water resistant, but I don’t care about that.\" — M\"I originally purchased at Target/Walmart but found a better deal here on Amazon. I wear department store cosmetics, but none of the pencil liners compare to this one - this one really stays and does not smudge. I've recommended it to many of my friends who ask how my liner stays on so nicely. It's easy to apply, and comes off easily with my face wash, but you don't get creases and it doesn't bleed into crows feet. Hope they never stop making this because I tried all the expensive and drug store pencils. Goes on like liner, but is a pencil with a smudger on one end.\" — GOLDEN GIRL While the price is a little higher than other options, this thick stick is an eyeshadow, pencil and eyeliner all in one. Reviewers say it’s easy to use and super pigmented.Promising review: \"Flattering On Older Eyes. I am in my late fifties and haven't worn anything on my eye lids for maybe 30 years. I love the smoky eye look and bought a couple of these little gems after watching a Sisley YouTube demonstration. My eye lids are hooded, crinkly and pinkie in colour but these apply SO easily and are very flattering. I now have 5 different colours and cant wait play around with them ever day. My only slight complaint is they are a tiny bit glittery, never the less I really like them.\" — Oast House\"I am a big fan of Sisley-Paris and use many of their products. I purchased this eyeshadow in 2 colors: Topaz and Havana. These glide smoothly on my mature eyelids and they are very easy to blend. you can build them up for a deeper color and also use them on the waterline with no transfer at all. I am in love with these!!!\" — Tali_A By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "People Over 60 Reveal What They Enjoy Most About This Time Of Their Life",
    "text": "Negative beliefs about aging run rampant in our culture, perpetuating the misconception that life stops being enjoyable or exciting after a certain age. But that’s just not true. There are lots of positives about being in your 60s and beyond, said Northern Virginia therapist Alicea Ardito, who works with older adults. Too often, though, we only hear about the downsides. “Many people embrace this phase as an opportunity to reinvent themselves, to try new things, to meet new people, to strengthen existing relationships or explore new connections, and redefine meaning and purpose,” she told HuffPost. We asked folks over the age of 60 in the HuffPost community to share what they’re enjoying most about this time in their life. Here’s what they told us. 1. “Learning that others’ opinions really don’t matter. I’m more eager to try new things without worrying I’ll look silly or fail, wear the clothes I like and ignore what the neighbors might be thinking (if they even do). There was a lot of scrutiny when I was growing up about doing the right thing, acting your age and I recently realized I don’t need anyone’s permission or criticism on the way I live my life. It’s no one’s business but my own and I am happier now that I’ve realized that.” — Mary Beth Schlemmer 2. “I worked six to seven days a week for 40 years. Retirement is a huge gift! I’m thankful for: control of my time, the privilege of moving at a slower pace, the ability to volunteer, the flexibility to visit with friends and family, finally having the time to pursue interests!” — Mary Jo F. 3. “I have so many things I’m enjoying at the ripe young age of 68. No. 1: Pension. No. 2: Social Security! But on another note. I have enjoyed the freedom of making my own schedule and the power of the word ‘NO’ without guilt.” — Brenda Braxton 4. “Valuing the friends in my life. Some of my friends have been with me for 60 years, others for only 20, but the cream has risen to the top and our devotion, loyalty and empathy for each other is invaluable. Every morning I wake up and text each one and we know how important our relationships are.” — Anne Rosenberg 5. “I appreciate the simple things in life. I’m still working full time as a teacher of special education young adults. Returned to school to finally get my special education endorsement. Life is a gift, never stop learning.” — Mary D. 6. “It’s no secret that at this age — I’m 65 — your skin gets saggy and wrinkly. However, it also gets thicker. When your time on the planet grows shorter, you really start doing some serious triage on your life. You’re impervious to all the stress that seemed so important in your first six decades, like work deadlines and finding your true love and pleasing everyone else in your life. You get to focus on what’s important to you, whether it’s taking up painting or reading every great novel ever written or finally doing charity work, even if friends and family discourage you. Which would explain why I came out as a trans woman at the age of 63. Instead of focusing on the negative reactions from others, I decided to zero in on the one thing that would bring me happiness.” — Caragh Donley 7. “No periods!” — MaryCharlotte H. 8. “Not caring much what people think of me. Very freeing. Being retired and not being overscheduled. Having wonderful adult children and getting to enjoy adorable grandchildren.” — Pamela B. 9. “No alarms to go to work. Priceless.” — Liz C. 10. “I say what I want, do what I want and never let anyone bully or talk down to me.” — Lynn G 11. “Learning that I don’t HAVE to do anything, as long as I’m willing to live with the consequences. I’ve thrown all those ‘I should, I need to, I have tos’ out the window after realizing I put pressure on myself that doesn’t need to be there. If I don’t feel like attending a function, I don’t. If I don’t mind a dusty floor, I don’t clean it. For whatever the thing is — and I own up to whatever consequence may result — I decide to not pressure myself into doing things I don’t want to or that would not add value to my day.” — Schlemmer 12. “Freedom. Total and complete freedom to live. And not being so exhausted.” — Joy A. 13. “Not being in a hurry!” — Donna W. 14. “Being my own boss. Even though I have a 90-year-old mom and two married sons along with all of the responsibilities that go along with those relationships, I am FINALLY my own boss! Only my 10 dogs are the bosses of me.” — Rosenberg 15. “Time to travel.” — Andee B. 16. “Peace and quiet” — Pamela R. 17. “I’m enjoying the fact that now I can be The Cool One in conversations. Cultural stereotypes have reduced my demographic to being senile boomer fools who still seem to think the only two musicians that matter are Elvis Presley and the Beatles. The only thing we supposedly have to look forward to is seeing which closes up first, our arteries or our political views. However, I still love discovering new music from any and all genres.

    "title": "The Best Products For The Crepey Skin On Your Neck, According To Dermatologists",
    "text": "Most of us are familiar with crepe paper — that dry, finely wrinkled and fragile material you’ve probably seen at a birthday party or two. Thanks to a variety of factors like aging, weight loss and sun damage, skin can adopt a similar texture, especially on areas like the neck. We corresponded with dermatologists who revealed that anyone wishing to regain a little more hydration, elasticity and smoothness in their neck skin can do so with products and ingredients that are widely available online. According to Dr. Navin Arora, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Borealis Dermatology in New York, once you do find the right product cocktail for you and your skin, consistency is key. “Regular use of skin care products that target skin elasticity and hydration can not only minimize the appearance of existing crepey skin but also strengthen the skin barrier against environmental stressors,” he said. In the list ahead, learn which products and ingredients that Arora, along with other skin experts, say you should consider adding to your daily routine. You’ll find antioxidant serums, plumping treatments and other crepe-fighting goods. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Board-certified and Texas-based dermatologist Dr. Seemal R. Desai at Innovative Dermatology previously spoke to HuffPost specifically about crepey skin and suggested the ever-favorite CeraVe moisturizing cream as a good hydrator for this particular skin concern.\"I recommend moisturizing with thick emollients, which helps to replace the ceramides and lipid concentration in the skin, which can help with overall skin hydration,\" Desai said. \"I really like the CeraVe moisturizing brand line, and I recommend the creams over lotions. One of my favorite moisturizers in the entire world, and one I recommend to patients every day, is the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It’s a rich, non-greasy and fast-absorbing cream that releases a steady stream of moisturizing ingredients, including essential ceramides and hyaluronic acid. It’s also fragrance-free, so it’s great for even the most sensitive skin types.” Dr. Elaine F. Kung, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Future Bright Dermatology in New York, suggested the Nectifirm firming neck treatment (containing the famed antioxidants C and E) by Revision Skincare, a brand whose product offerings have been suggested to us before.The formula features plant extracts and five different peptides which Kung explained are amino acids used as the building blocks for collagen production in the skin. The result is skin that appears more lifted, feels firmer and more resilient. \"Retinol has been scientifically proven to thicken both the epidermis and the dermis,\" Kung said. \"It also stimulates the production of collagen and elastin within the dermis.\" In order to find a suitable retinol-containing product we turned to a previous suggestion from Dr. Y. Claire Chang, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology.This rapid wrinkle repair cream by Neutrogena uses an accelerated retinol complex to promote cellular turnover. It also contains a hydrating dose of hyaluronic acid, an ingredient suggested by Kung, and can be suitable in treating crepey skin.Note that if you're new to retinols, they do have the potential to cause mild flaking and irritation in the first couple weeks of use. They can also cause skin to be more sensitive to the sun, so it's important to wear sunscreen. Speaking of collagen and its essential role in skin elasticity, Kung also recommended this supercharged collagen-boosting serum formulated to make complexions dewy and plump so lines look less obvious and skin feels less dry. It uses a brand-exclusive 10% peptide complex as well as soothing aloe, collagen and hyaluronic acid, an tried-and-true humectant that helps to draw moisture into the skin to keep it hydrated. Dr. Navin Arora, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Borealis Dermatology in New York, as well as Kung, suggested this neck-specific formula by SkinCeuticals, a clinical skin care brand that frequently comes with dermatologist's stamp of approval for their effective formulas. \"[It's] an amazing combination of retinol and peptides that is specifically formulated to tighten delicate neck skin,\" Arora said of this daily cream that contains a 0.2% concentration of slow-release retinol, a time-honored ingredient that accelerates the skin's cellular turnover rate, promoting collagen production. Hydrating seed oils are supplemented with a 5% glaucine complex, a plant-derived ingredient that can support skin's natural resistance to premature aging. According to Arora, the Techno Neck Perfecting Cream by Skinbetter Science is popular product that improves crepiness, dryness, sagging, laxity and texture in the skin of the neck and décolleté. \"A key ingredient is heptapeptide-7, a targeted peptide that supports the skin's collagen network,\" he said. The formula contains a smart combination of hydroxy acids and a uniquely formulated form of vitamin A that's similar to retinol, but won't cause excess irritation. You can also expect a whole host of ingredients that can improve the look and feel of skin from niacinamide, a faithful brightener, squalane, an emollient to help skin retain moisture and a targeted peptide to plump fine lines. Recommended by Kung, Alastin's Restorative Neck Complex claims to be a \"next-generation skin tightener\" that's specifically designed to address crepey skin on the neck and chest while also fighting redness and discoloration. The product's power lies in a blend of active peptides that work to support the production of collagen and elastin. There's also the addition of phytoene and phytofluene, two powerful antioxidants that protect the skin from collagen-depleting stressors. \"Vitamin C is a cofactor in collagen synthesis. Its antioxidant properties help protect skin cells from sun and environmental damage,\" Kung said, of this well-studied ingredient that can do everything from evening skin tone to addressing dullness and fine lines. Though Kung didn't recommend a specific vitamin C-containing product, New York City-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Brendan Camp previously suggested this 15%-concentrated serum by Dr. Dennis Gross. It also features lactic acid, a chemical exfoliant that can help address irregular skin texture and increase product absorption thereby enhancing antioxidant potential. Both Kung and Arora stressed the importance of prevention when it comes to managing crepey skin, specifically when it comes to the damaging potential of the sun.\"Use sunscreen with zinc and titanium oxide,\" Kung said. \"UV exposure breaks down collagen and elastin in skin that help it stay tight and firm. Once these fibers break down, the skin can loosen, thin and wrinkle.\"Camp (along with several other dermatologists in the past) previously suggested this sunscreen from Elta MD, which according to him, can also shield skin from visible UV rays in overhead lighting because of its tinted formula. The zinc oxide- and octinoxate-based formula features SPF 46 along with high-purity niacinamide, a well-known anti-inflammatory that reduces redness and helps to restore damaged skin. While on the topic of sun protection for your neck, Camp previously said that you should consider wearing a scarf or neck gaiter made of lightweight UPF fabric. \"Ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) fabrics provide protection by blocking the sun’s rays. Sun scarves and neck gaiters can complement an SPF moisturizer,\" he said.Based on his suggestion, we found this gender-neutral bandana made from a soft and cool UPF fabric blocks 98% of the sun's harmful UVA and UVB rays. It comes in four colors like black, apricot and white.

    "title": "The 'Best Sheets Known To Man' Are On Sale At Target — But The Deal Disappears Soon",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Good bedding rarely comes cheap, so when we do find a good deal on a highly-rated set, you can bet we’ll shout it from the rooftops. Target’s 400 thread-count cotton performance sheets were already quite a steal starting at a mere $30 for a twin/twin XL set, and they came very highly recommended by former BuzzFeed Shopping writer Kayla Suazo and over 3,600 5-star reviewers. But right now, if you’ve joined Target’s free loyalty program, Target Circle, you can find a deep discount on these beloved sheets ― up to 25%! This deal is a Target Circle Bonus, a coupon you can clip right on the page to take $10 off any bath or bedding item when you spend $40 or more. That knocks $10 off a full-size sheet set, normally $40, down to $30. But you’ll have to hurry because this deal ends tomorrow! Designed in 12 prints and 11 solid colors (availability is mixed depending on the size and color combination), they’re available in twin, full, queen, king, and California king sizes. The set consists of a fitted sheet that promises to fit a mattress up to 18 inches in depth, a flat sheet and two pillowcases for sizes full-California king or one pillowcase for sizes twin and twin XL. The 100% cotton material is brushed with a bright sateen finish and promises to resist wrinkling, pilling and shrinkage. In the story in which she called this bedding set “the best sheets known to man,” Suazo wrote, “These sheets are soft and cozy, but not in a super-silky way... And because the bottom sheet has that amazing band, the bedding hardly moves. As for comfort, they’re pleasantly soft and also have this crisp feeling to them, just like hotel sheets.” She found that they held up, too: “I’ve had them for a few months now, washing them biweekly, and they still have that brand-new feel.” The kicker? “[G]et this: I have (much pricier) white 700-thread-count sheets that I’ve washed with my Target bedding, and I can’t tell them apart when I take them out of the dryer.” Regarding this current deal, take note: You only get $10 off your $40 bath and bedding order once, and per customer. Meaning, if you’re planning to order multiple sheet sets, you’re out of luck unless you use a different Target Circle account to claim the same coupon. Given that it’s single-use only, the coupon doesn’t stack, so if you’ve got $80 worth of bath and bedding goodies in your cart, you won’t get $20 off. “These are by far the best sheets I’ve ever sleep on. I’m 64 and was fortunate to travel and stay in many [high] end hotels. These sheets are better than any. They have a certain thickness that is perfect. They get better with time. Fit incredibly. You won’t be sorry if you get a set. Just incredible.” — Like to sleepzzzzz  “Great quality, has a nice cold feel which I love. Definitely buying more of these in different colors.” — Q  “These are the softest sheets, and so nice when making the bed because the corner pockets are deep. High quality & received compliments from guests staying over… so now I’m going to buy a second set!!” — Kmom Smaller throws are cute and cozy, but it's worth it to have an extra blanket that actually fits your whole bed, especially if your regular duvet or comforter isn't keeping you warm enough at night. Try this Room Essentials sherpa blanket that's available in twin/twin XL and full/queen sizes. It's midweight, machine-washable and available in gray or white. It also has an average 4.6-star rating across over 1,300 reviews, so it's safe to say reviewers approve. Promising review: \"Best blanket for tv watching on the couch. Incredibly soft and stays soft even after numerous washings. Warm. I can’t wait to get under it at the end of a night. Our dog loves it for cuddling, too! I’ve already bought two others as gifts—that’s how confident I am others will love it. You won’t be disappointed.\" — Melissa S Microfiber sheets can be a godsend in colder weather, because of their ability to trap heat better than cotton. While this Room Essentials microfiber sheet set isn't technically a new release for the season, some of the 13 colors and patterns — like the rusty orange floral shown here — are perfect for fall, just like the material. The set comes in four sizes, with one flat sheet, one fitted sheet and two pillowcases. Promising review: \"The pattern is subtle, but so cute, and my husband was agreeable to florals on our bed because of this set :) The price point is perfect. They are soft and durable, and our other microfiber sheet sets from this brand have held up well after multiple washes and toddler accidents.\" — Steph S HuffPost readers adore flannel sheets and they're an ideal cozy fabric when the weather gets colder, so this new Threshold set is a must-have. The machine-washable set includes a flat sheet, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, and is available in four sizes and four fall-ready colors. The fitted sheet can work with a mattress depth of up to 17 inches. If you're in the market for a new comforter, look no further than this tasteful faux fur set by Threshold. It includes a comforter and two pillow shams made with soft faux fur in an eye-catching but subtle knotted pattern. The set is available in two sizes and is machine-washable. Best of all, the neutral khaki color is so versatile you might not even want to swap this set out when fall is over. Promising review: \"I was skeptical, but this comforter set is amazing! The fact that it's machine washable makes it 10/10. It's heavenly soft and got even better after I washed it! Only time will tell how it holds up, but at this price point, it's more than worth it to me.\" — Tainalynn The soft coziness of jersey sheets makes them a great pick for colder months, especially if you're generally a cold sleeper. This Becky Cameron set is designed to be both breathable and durable, and comes with a flat sheet, fitted sheet and two pillowcases. The whole set is machine-washable. The fitted sheet has deep pockets that can fit a mattress up to 14 inches tall. It's available in six colors. Promising review: \"We were pretty impressed with these sheets and was initially alittle worried with how well it will wash being jersey material. Washed them 2x already and have held up well worn minimal stretching to the material. Great for the upcoming fall.\" — freyfrey",

    "title": "This Pillow Isn't Just For Sex. It Can Help You Sleep Better Too.",
    "text": "Real (pillow) talk: Wedge pillows can truly be the bedroom addition that your sex life never knew it needed. These versatile items can help you achieve a near endless array of intimate positions with much more comfort and stability and for longer periods of time. But that might be a story for a different day, because according to medical professionals, wedge pillows can also serve a much more conventional purpose. Dr. Kristle Lynch, a gastroenterologist and spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association, explained to HuffPost that common conditions such acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly known as GERD, can occur when a person’s stomach is full and they lie down flat, as contents from the stomach may then move backwards more easily and flow into the esophagus. “This may cause troublesome symptoms of acid reflux, including heartburn and liquid regurgitation,” Lynch said, adding that it’s normal for the stomach to have acidic contents, but not the esophagus. “A wedge pillow keeps the esophagus and stomach at a more upright angle and can be helpful in letting gravity assist with forward movement of stomach contents when one is asleep,” Lynch said. Those who chronically experience these symptoms may find it helpful to invest in a wedge pillow, which are often made from foams of varying densities and come in a variety heights, although Lynch’s pro tip is to opt for one that is six to eight inches tall. “Sometimes patients will buy a 12-inch one, but they slide down given the steep incline,” she said. “Keep in mind that you can use a regular pillow on top of a wedge pillow to make it more comfortable for your neck.” Speaking of the neck and back, The Sleep Foundation says that “a wedge pillow can help promote proper spinal alignment and relieve pressure on the back, neck, and shoulders.” There’s also research to suggest that sleeping in a supported, inclined position can reduce snoring and obtrusive sleep apnea, as well as nasal congestion. Whether you’ve been convinced to try a wedge pillow for alleviating acid reflux or neck pain or for reasons of a more sexy variety, peruse the upcoming list of wedge pillows that include adjustable height pillows, leg wedges and of course the Liberator, a wedge and ramp combination pillow that was actually designed for sex, though it works well for addressing discomfort, too.

    "title": "Biden Bans Fossil Fuel Drilling Across 600 Million Acres Of U.S. Waters",
    "text": "President Joe Biden on Monday permanently banned oil and gas drilling across 625 million acres of federal waters. Along with cementing Biden’s legacy on combating global climate change, the withdrawal is likely to deliver a lasting blow to President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for unfettered fossil fuel development in the coming years. Biden’s order — the largest such mineral withdrawal in U.S. history — permanently protects coastal waters spanning the entire Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as the eastern Gulf of Mexico and 44 million acres of the Northern Bering Sea, off the coast of western Alaska. In a statement Monday, Biden invoked the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, calling it “a solemn reminder of the costs and risks of offshore drilling,” and said drilling in the newly protected coastal areas “could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs.” “It is not worth the risks,” he said. “As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren.” The sweeping protections rely on a provision of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives presidents the power to permanently block offshore leasing for oil and gas development. The law, however, does not include language giving presidents the authority to reverse such a withdrawal. When President Barack Obama invoked that same provision of the law in 2016 to block offshore drilling in large areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, a White House official said the protections would “stand the test of time.” That has proven true. In 2019, a judge ruled that Trump’s 2017 executive order revoking the Obama-era ban was unlawful and only Congress could lift such withdrawal. During his first term in office, Trump and his team proposed opening nearly all U.S. waters — roughly 90% of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf — to fossil fuel development. Yet like Obama and now Biden, Trump used section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to withdraw coastal waters around Florida, Georgia and South Carolina from future drilling, in what many saw as political maneuvering in swing states during an election year. Asked over the weekend about Biden’s forthcoming order, Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump, told The New York Times that the Biden administration is waging a “war on American energy” — a go-to claim that ignores the fact that domestic oil and gas production are at record highs. “When he takes office, President Trump will make America energy dominant again, protect our energy jobs, and bring down the cost of living for working families,” Ms. Leavitt said in a statement. Environmental groups applauded Monday’s announcement. “Americans have been calling for these protections for decades, and Oceana applauds President Biden for building on the legacy of Democratic and Republican presidents protecting our coasts from offshore drilling,” Joseph Gordon, director of climate and energy at Oceana, an ocean advocacy group, said in a statement. “Our coastlines are home to millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a clean coast, abundant wildlife, and thriving fisheries.” Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas trade association, condemned the ban and called on Congress and the incoming Trump administration to “use every tool at their disposal to reverse this politically motivated decision and restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Biden Won't Enforce TikTok Ban, Leaving Fate Of App To Trump",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden won’t enforce a ban on the social media app TikTok that is set to take effect a day before he leaves office on Monday, a U.S. official said Thursday, leaving its fate in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump. Congress last year, in a law signed by Biden, required that TikTok’s China-based parent company ByteDance divest the company by Jan. 19, a day before the presidential inauguration. The official said the outgoing administration was leaving the implementation of the law — and the potential enforcement of the ban — to Trump. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal Biden administration thinking. Trump, who once called to ban the app, has since pledged to keep it available in the U.S., though his transition team has not said how they intend to accomplish that. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to attend Trump’s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais as the president-elect’s national security adviser signals that the incoming administration may take steps to “keep TikTok from going dark.” Incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz on Thursday told Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” that the federal law that could ban TikTok by Sunday also “allows for an extension as long as a viable deal is on the table.” The push to save TikTok, much like the move to ban it in the U.S., has crossed partisan lines. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he spoke with Biden on Thursday to advocate for extending the deadline to ban TikTok. “It’s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans, of so many influencers who have built up a good network of followers,” Schumer said Thursday on the Senate floor. Democrats had tried on Wednesday to pass legislation that would have extended the deadline, but Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas blocked it. Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that TikTok has had ample time to find a buyer. “TikTok is a Chinese Communist spy app that addicts our kids, harvests their data, targets them with harmful and manipulative content, and spreads communist propaganda,” Cotton said. TikTok CEO’s is expected to be seated on the dais for the inauguration along with tech billionaires Elon Musk, who is CEO of SpaceX, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to two people with the matter. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning. Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets. “If the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he’s going to protect their data,” Waltz said on Wednesday. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Separately on Wednesday, Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick for attorney general, dodged a question during a Senate hearing on whether she’d uphold a TikTok ban. Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to “save TikTok” during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.

    "text": "Comedian Bill Burr said Tuesday that he’d bought a helicopter to escape Los Angeles with his family ― but when the time came, his plan went awry. (Watch the video below.) Host Jimmy Kimmel began his interview with the funnyman by chatting about the wildfires roaring through Los Angeles. Burr, he recalled, had told him he’d gotten his pilot’s license so “in case all hell broke loose in LA, ... you could get out of LA.” “At any moment did you think, ’I’m gonna make a run for the helicopter?” the talk show host asked. “Well the error in my thought was, I didn’t realize how expensive helicopters were,” Burr, a married father of two, replied. “So all I have is a two-seater, and I didn’t want to have to make ‘Sophie’s Choice’ with my family, so we all piled into the SUV like everybody else.” While Burr, who has a comedy special on Hulu in March, was able to try to make light of the unfolding horror, other celebrities haven’t been as fortunate. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Anna Faris, Adam Brody and Leighton Meester, Ricki Lake, Cameron Mathison, Joshua Jackson, Cary Elwes, Mel Gibson and Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag have lost their homes in the wildfires, People reported. The fires have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Fast-forward to 1:28 for Burr’s helicopter dilemma.

    "title": "Billy Ray Cyrus Struggles Through A Pretty Weird Inauguration Performance",
    "text": "Country music star Billy Ray Cyrus had a rough night on the stage as he performed at the Liberty Ball celebrating the inauguration of President Donald Trump on Monday night. Cyrus seemed to be plagued by a mix of technical difficulties and a hoarse voice as he performed without a band. The appearance began with the full video for Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” featuring Cyrus, with Cyrus on the stage as the video played strumming his guitar, singing along and encouraging the crowd. When the video ended, he strummed more of the song on his guitar and whistled. He also attempted an a cappella version of the song where he called on the crowd to clap and sing along. “If you encourage me, I’ll keep going,” he said. “They told me to kill as much time as possible.” Then his guitar cut out. “Is anybody awake?” he called out to the tech crew. “Where’s everybody at? Is anyone back there? Can somebody turn my guitar back on?” Someone emerged, but couldn’t get the guitar to work. Cyrus noted that Carrie Underwood also had technical difficulties at the inauguration ceremony earlier in the day, and had to perform an a cappella version of “America the Beautiful” when the orchestral track cut out. “Wasn’t Carrie Underwood fabulous?” he said. “They had technical difficulties too. And in life, when you have technical difficulties, you just gotta keep going.

    "title": "I Aged 20 Years In Just 2 Weeks After Being Treated For A Shocking Medical Diagnosis",
    "text": "Halfway through hot yoga class — my first in over a decade — I felt a volcanic wave of heat rise inside my chest. While a sea of spandex-clad bodies moved balletically around me, I collapsed on my mat in child’s pose. Sweat dripped from my brow. The heater across the room hissed and blasted another gust of scorching air into the small, sealed studio. As I tried to catch my breath, the 20-something yoga instructor yelled over the electropop playlist, “If you want to experience growth, you need to do more!” I couldn’t help but feel like she was speaking directly to me, and so, I mustered my last bit of energy. But when I rose to join the class in warrior two, the heat inside my chest exploded into flames. I was having a massive hot flash. I did not finish that yoga class. Instead, I rolled up my mat and fled the studio for the air-conditioned bathroom where I stuck my head under the ice-cold faucet. It took an hour for my body to return to a state of homeostasis, and I felt exhausted and dehydrated for days, no matter how many electrolytes I consumed. In hindsight, I’m not sure what possessed me to attend hot yoga in the first place. Ever since breast cancer treatments pushed me into sudden and premature induced menopause at 37 years old, I’ve suffered chronic, debilitating hot flashes. Sitting in the sun for too long can trigger an episode, let alone an hour-long exercise class in 100-degree infra-red heat. In October 2017, I found a lump — the shape and density of a marble — sitting just above my right breast. I assumed it was something left over from nursing my then 18-month-old son, however, two years prior, I lost my mother to a fast-moving Chondrosarcoma and painstakingly learned that with cancer early detection is everything. As I pushed down on the mass under my skin, I made a mental note to follow up with my primary care doctor, just in case. Later that week, following a mammogram and biopsy, I discovered that my breast cancer diagnosis was early-onset and estrogen receptor positive (ER+), meaning I wouldn’t need chemotherapy. Two months later, I underwent a unilateral mastectomy and post-op began a 10-year adjuvant treatment: a daily medication, Letrozole, to wipe out all the estrogen in my body, and quarterly Lupron injections to shut down my ovaries. “These two treatments will push you into menopause,” my oncologist informed me, as if he was explaining a simple math equation. “You may or may not experience symptoms.” “OK,” I responded. At the time, I knew so little about menopause I didn’t have any follow-up questions. That quickly changed. Within a matter of weeks, an onslaught of symptoms hit me with a brute force. I suffered insomnia and night sweats, muscle and body aches, brain fog, mood swings, fatigue and hot flashes. I also had symptoms of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM), which caused frequent urinary tract infections and vaginal dryness that disrupted my sex life. At 37 years old, I was Benjamin Button in reverse — I’d aged 20 years in only two weeks. It felt as though the cancer medications had hijacked my body and left me marooned in an unknown land — menopause. I woke every night drenched in cold sweat, as if someone poured a glass of water over my head. My joints cracked like an old wooden floorboard whenever I stood up. My mood was all over the place, and I became short-tempered with my two young children. I was confused about my symptoms, and I felt isolated in my experience. I couldn’t talk to my close friends about what I was going through because nobody else in my peer group had been through it yet. “Have you tried any homeopathic remedies?” my primary care doctor asked me one day. I was back on her examination table bemoaning my menopausal symptoms. “A few supplements and vitamins might help.” Later that afternoon, I went home and googled “menopause cure.” I poured over the vast selection of expensive organic remedies — supplements, vitamins, treatments — that popped up on my screen. I quickly ordered a pharmaceutical grade Vitamin D3 supplement and women’s daily vitamin, both of which helped to somewhat alleviate my chronic aches and pain. Over the next few days, I noticed that my targeted algorithms had adjusted, and an array of ads took over my Instagram feed, touting everything from menopause face serums and shampoos to herbal teas. At first, I found it impossible to resist the beautifully packaged products — the promise that a green juice or body oil might restore my stolen youth. I purchased an expensive Aegean sea scrub to combat my dry skin, and an overpriced “menopause protein powder.” And while none of these products really worked, there always seemed to be another one I could buy. Over the past decade, menopause has become an industry projected to be worth $24.4 billion by 2030. Despite a recent positive shift in public discourse around menopause — thanks in part to public figures like Drew Barrymore and Gayle King who have opened up about their experiences — capitalism has sunk its teeth into the “menopause industry” and continues to perpetuate a negative culture of anti-aging. I know it took me a minute to make the distinction between “healthy aging and improved quality of life” and “anti-aging,” but my Amazon cart had become proof enough. In my effort to turn back the clock, I’d fallen prey to the falsity that aging is shameful, and worse, it’s somehow magically avoidable — if only we buy and apply the right face serum. Over the years, I’ve learned that menopause isn’t just about hot flashes and dry skin, it’s also about the increased risk for serious medical conditions, like dementia and osteoporosis. I’ve learned that taking proper care of my body and mind means investing in my future health. For instance, I’ve adjusted my exercise routines to focus on bone strength and mobility rather than weight loss. I’ve also learned that this next stage of life is about coming to terms with shifting relationships — marriages, friendships and family — and empty nesting. It’s about reexamining value systems and reprioritizing what’s important in life. For me, it’s been about redefining my expectations around beauty and my sense of self-worth, as well as letting go of the need to measure up to anyone else’s standards but my own. I’ve come to understand that with aging comes deeper wisdom and better discernment. As I get older, I’ve learned that I don’t need to do more to experience growth and change, I can just do things differently. When I was first diagnosed with cancer, I became acutely aware that time is the most precious commodity. During those first few days, while I waited for my biopsy results, I stayed awake at night consumed with fear and anxiety. I wanted to live to see my two sons grow up. I wanted to experience life as a grandmother. In other words, I desperately wanted to survive cancer and grow older. But when my hormone treatment slammed me into induced menopause, it felt like what was left of my youth was taken from me. I quickly lost sight of what was important: I was still alive. These days, when I look in the mirror, I see someone who has survived cancer and the intense grief of losing a parent. Cancer and sudden induced menopause gave me the opportunity to prematurely confront my own mortality and decide what’s important to me: my family, my health, my friends, my career. It helped me to embrace the idea that aging isn’t something that needs to be fixed. There isn’t a cure for menopause. It’s just another part of life. I’m thankful that I learned this lesson while I’m still young-ish. I went to that hellfire hot yoga class at the behest of my friend. I remember thinking that if I could just finish the class, it would mean that I was back to my old self — my pre-cancer self. But maybe we don’t have to shoulder some great burden to feel young again. Sometimes, I still feel like I’m 25 years old. Other days, I feel like a shell of the person I used to be. On those days, I try to slow down and practice self-compassion, something I struggled with before surviving breast cancer. I remind myself that self-love means I don’t always have to do the full expression of the pose. Sometimes it’s enough to show up, sit on your mat, and breathe.

    "title": "Patrick And Brittany Mahomes Welcome Baby No. 3",
    "text": "Patrick and Brittany Mahomes have expanded their family, and their newborn’s name is the perfect icing on the cake. On Monday, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, 29, and the Kansas City Current co-owner, also 29, announced in a joint Instagram post that they’d welcomed their third baby, daughter Golden Raye Mahomes, over the weekend. “Golden Raye Mahomes • 1/12/25,” the pair captioned their post. The accompanying photo shows two tiny baby feet near a sign that reads “Golden Raye.” Golden’s name fits what seems to be a pattern for the Mahomes family, whose two older children ― Sterling Skye, 3, and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, 2 ― likewise have names or nicknames related to metals. Patrick and Brittany Mahomes welcomed Sterling in February 2021 and Bronze in November 2022. The family’s affinity for metallic monikers also extends to their pups, who are named Silver and Steel. Last July, Brittany announced in an Instagram post that she and Patrick were expecting a third baby. “Round three, here we come,” the parents wrote, alongside clips of them showing off sonogram images with an excited Sterling and Bronze during a photo shoot. In a follow-up post just days later, Patrick and Brittany revealed the gender of their third baby. “Baby Mahomes #3 is a....💙🩷,” they captioned the post, which showed them announcing they were having another girl through a family game of tic-tac-toe. In October 2022, the three-time Super Bowl MVP opened up about fatherhood during an episode of “Football in America.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Brooke Shields Shocks ‘GMA’ Hosts By Laughing At Rude Comment She Got Online",
    "text": "Brooke Shields seems to be enjoying the IDGAF season of her life. The 59-year-old actor, known for 1978′s “Pretty Baby” and 1980′s “The Blue Lagoon” when she was a teen, visited “Good Morning America” on Monday to promote her new book, “Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old.” In the memoir, the former model describes her experience of aging “as she flips the script on the idea of what it means for a woman to grow older,” according to her publisher’s summary. Midway through her “GMA” interview, Shields recalled an ironic remark a fan recently aimed at her while she was promoting her book. “I was doing an Instagram Live the other day,” Shields began. “And one of the comments was, ‘I really wish you looked the way you used to.’” But instead of being offended or seeking validation, she threw her head back and began to laugh. The camera then panned to “GMA” anchor Robin Roberts who looked utterly shocked by Shield’s response. “This is why you don’t read comments!” Rebecca Jarvis said as Shields continued to crack up. “Never read the comments!” echoed Lara Spencer. “And I thought, ‘Boy, we’re all so out of touch, we need to find joy’” in aging,” Shields said after she was done laughing. Earlier in the interview, Shields summed up why she has such a generous attitude toward disparaging remarks about her appearance. “The beauty industry wants us to chase youth; we look at regrets — what if, what if,” Shields said. “And I think it’s important to understand where you’ve been, but I think it’s really joyous to say, ‘I may not know where I’m going, but I’m here.’” She added that she wants to “look my best and I want to be healthy,” but said her focus isn’t on battling aging. “I’ve earned everything that I have on my face,” she said. “And I think it’s important to pat yourself on your back and say, ‘What do you want to do now?’” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Pamela Anderson made headlines in 2023 when she showed up at Paris Fashion Week without makeup, and she has continued to wear very little publicly ever since. The 57-year-old “Baywatch” alum later told the fashion and lifestyle outlet Highsnobiety that ditching her signature glamazon look was part of her “healing experience.” “We all get roped into ‘Oh, I want to be successful so I can have this and this, and show people that I’m cool, chic, admired,’” Anderson said. “And then we’re all just left with debt and a fancy car.

    "title": "'A Life That Was Worth So Much More Than $2.50!' Bus Driver Fatally Shot Over Fare",
    "text": "Three juveniles were arrested following the fatal shooting of a Georgia bus driver after they refused to pay the fare, Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority police announced earlier this week. Leroy Ramos, 47, was shot multiple times on the night of Jan. 3, after MARTA police say the three juveniles got into an argument with him at Decatur Station in the metro-Atlanta area, according to the announcement. The three suspects are now in police custody and are being charged with murder. Cellphone footage of the incident obtained by WSB-TV appears to show the teens refusing to pay the $2.50 bus fare. Another MARTA employee can be seen holding Ramos back before one juvenile in a red hood appears to pull out a gun and shoot Ramos several times. MARTA police confirmed that Ramos was killed during “fare dispute,” and a bystander was taken to the hospital with a “superficial” bullet wound, WRDW reports. Ramos’ death has sparked a greater conversation over the nationwide rise of violent assaults on transit workers, which according to data by the Urban Institute, have tripled since 2008. Ramos’ family is rallying against gun violence and for safe working conditions for public service workers in GoFundMe honoring the bus driver. “This isn’t the first act of gun violence or any kind of violence within the public! As a community (all communities), we need to make a change, not just in Atlanta but all over the United States!” the family member wrote. “This tragic incident happened over a fare dispute that resulted in us losing a life that was worth so much more than $2.50!” the statement continued.“Our family is enduring this senseless act of violence firsthand and mourns the loss of a soul that was precious and so priceless to us, 3 days into the new year.” MARTA General Manager and CEO Collie Greenwood addressed the incident in a video posted on social media, saying, “Like so many public interactions, this did not need to escalate.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

He said Ramos had only been working as a bus operator since October, but “had already established himself as a friend to many of his co-workers.” Ramos was described in the fundraiser by a family member as a loving husband and father “who came from humble beginnings” and “a man who valued life itself.” “He was the type of man that would show up for anyone and everyone, even if he didn’t know them,” the family member wrote. “Just one call or encounter, and he would sacrifice his last to help!” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "‘I Broke The Law': Capitol Rioters Reject Trump’s Pardons, Demand Accountability",
    "text": "At least two people who pleaded guilty for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol say they don’t want pardons for what they did, with one saying President Donald Trump can “shove his pardon up his a**.” “I am guilty of the crimes I have committed and accept the consequences,” Jason Riddle, who was sentenced to 90 days in jail for two misdemeanor offenses, told ABC News. Riddle of New Hampshire admitted to drinking pilfered wine and stealing a book on Senate procedure from the Capitol during the 2021 violence. At the time of the attack, he said he was an “obsessor” of Trump and struggling with alcohol. His probation included him attending alcoholic treatment. “It is thanks to those consequences I now have a happy and fruitful existence,” he said. “I don’t need to obsess over a narcissistic bully to feel better about myself,” he said. “Trump can shove his pardon up his ass.” Pamela Hemphill, a 71-year-old woman from Idaho who was publicly branded “MAGA Granny” after her participation in the events, also said she would refuse Trump’s pardon. “I’m not going to take it. I gotta do some research on who to contact to refuse it,” she told KGW8. “The message is, if I took a pardon, that what I did that day was OK,” she said. “They were criminals. They broke the law. I broke the law. Pay the price.” The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in U.S. v. Wilson back in 1833 that a presidential pardon may “be rejected by the person to whom it is tendered.” “And if it be rejected, we have discovered no power in a court to force it on him,” Chief Justice John Marshall wrote at the time. Hemphill served two months in a federal prison in 2022 as part of a plea deal after prosecutors said she pushed past police barriers and rallied other rioters to follow her lead. “Just come on it. What are you doing, just get in here. It’s your house,” she hollered, as seen in video she took of the events. She said she fully believed that the election had been stolen from Trump and that if enough people fought back, he would stay in office.

    "title": "Carrie Underwood Sings A Cappella At Trump's Inauguration After Technical Glitch",
    "text": "Carrie Underwood overcame a technical snafu Monday as she delivered her much-buzzed-about rendition of “America the Beautiful” at President Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony. The “American Idol” veteran and country star was slated to be joined by the Armed Forces Chorus and the United States Naval Academy Glee Club. However, she was forced to act quickly when an orchestral track meant to accompany her performance appeared to cut out after a few seconds. “You know the words ― help me out here,” Underwood said after a crew member alerted her of the audio malfunction. She then launched into the song a cappella as many attendees ― including former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris ― joined her in singing along. Watch Carrie Underwood perform “America the Beautiful” below. Many were impressed by the eight-time Grammy winner’s ability to improvise under pressure. “Carrie Underwood is a true professional. She didn’t let the unfortunate tech failure keep her from a pitch perfect singing of ‘America The Beautiful,’” one person wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “No matter what anyone’s politics might be, she was awesome.” Added another: “Carrie Underwood pulled off a Mean Girls Jingle Bell Rock moment.” Others, however, offered a more critical take. “shoutout to the gay who pulled the plug on the audio before carrie underwood sang,” one person quipped, alluding to the pushback the singer received from many members of her LGBTQ+ fanbase upon agreeing to the performance.

Though she expressed her support for same-sex marriage in 2012, she has also appeared to back certain conservative beliefs, most notably in 2020 when she liked a video on X posted by right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh, in which he denounced COVID-19 mask mandates for children. Last week, she appeared to preemptively dismiss criticisms of her decision to perform for Trump in a statement issued to The New York Times and Variety, among other outlets. “I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,” she said. “I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Christina Applegate Calls Out ‘Real Sick’ Trolls For Mocking LA Fire Victims",
    "text": "Christina Applegate is slamming the “real sick” people who have mocked celebrity victims of the ongoing wildfires that have devastated the Greater Los Angeles area. During Tuesday’s episode of her “MeSsy” podcast, which she hosts with fellow actor Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Applegate, 53, shared that she and her daughter Sadie are on “constant alert” to find out if they will have to evacuate their home again amid the fires. “Sopranos” star Sigler said “there’s not really words” for the terrifying blaze. That prompted Applegate to unleash her thoughts on the people online who’ve said the massive wildfires — which have destroyed thousands of homes, schools and businesses and have left at least two dozen people dead — are a good thing. “You know what I have words for? Fucking people who are saying that it’s, you know, good. ‘It’s Hollywood and those stupid Hollywood people’ — like, you’ve gotta be kidding me,” Applegate replied. The “Dead to Me” star tried to shut down misconceptions that people who live outside LA have about the city, claiming that some believe “celebrities are walking around running everything.” “We’re a small portion of the city,” Applegate explained. “I mean, this is a city of people that are working their asses off at fast food chains or, you know, fucking builders and painters, and it’s a myriad of groups of humans here. So to say ‘good riddance’ is real sick, and I’m not liking that whatsoever.” When Sigler urged Applegate to “tune out” the negative comments, the “Married... with Children” star agreed, replying, “I’ve tuned it out because they’re ridiculous, but I’m calling them out right now.” Sigler went on to say that the city’s residents are “there for big dreams” and “work their fucking asses off. “And sure. Is there a group of people that have been affected that will have the ability to rebuild their lives — I wouldn’t say easily, but soon? Yes. And are there thousands of other people that literally have no idea where they will begin? Yes. And we have to hold both of them in our hearts.” Elsewhere in the episode, Applegate, who told listeners that she was recently able to return home after spending two nights evacuated in a hotel last week, shared that she and her family have been on “constant alert.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Federal Courts Won't Refer Clarence Thomas To Attorney General Over Ethics",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal courts will not refer allegations that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may have violated ethics laws to the Justice Department, the judiciary’s policymaking body said Thursday. Thomas has agreed to follow updated requirements on reporting trips and gifts, including clearer guidelines on hospitality from friends, the U.S. Judicial Conference wrote to Democratic senators who had called for an investigation into undisclosed acceptance of luxury trips. Thomas has previously said he wasn’t required to disclose the many trips he and his wife took that were paid for by wealthy benefactors like Republican megadonor Harlan Crow because they are close personal friends. The court didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. The Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 in the face of sustained criticism, though the new code still lacks a means of enforcement. It’s unclear whether the law allows the U.S. Judicial Conference to make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice, U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad wrote. He serves as secretary for the conference, which sets policy for the federal court system and is led by Chief Justice John Roberts. A referral in this case isn’t necessary, Conrad said, because two Democratic senators called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel over the summer. No such appointment has been publicly made. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

The group Fix the Court said the financial disclosure law is clear and should apply to justices. “The Conference’s letters further underscore the need for Congress to create a new and transparent mechanism to investigate the justices for ethics violations since the Conference is unwilling to act upon the one method we had presumed existed to do that,” Executive Director Gabe Roth said in a statement. Conrad also sent a similar response to a separate complaint from a conservative legal group, the Center for Renewing America, in regard to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s reports on the source of her husband’s consulting income. Jackson has since amended her disclosures and also agreed to updated reporting requirements, Conrad wrote.

    "title": "10 Products Reviewers Claim Resolved Their Sink Drainage Issues Without Needing A Plumber",
    "text": "We all run into drainage problems at one point or another, especially if you live in a busy home. And while a sink or bathtub that drains very, very slowly might throw a wrench in your day, you don’t have to call an expensive plumber to come to your home to fix it. From drain snakes to liquid clog removers, we rounded up the best home improvement products for bathroom and kitchen drains that shoppers swear by from Amazon and Walmart. According to these shopper reviews, you don’t need to break the bank to call a plumber to fix your drainage issues. Even if you don’t have a lot of experience clearing out a blockage in a bathtub or sink, these items are easy to use and just get the job done. Ahead, you’ll find our recommendations for the best drainage products that don’t require a plumber, according to shoppers. Remember to use everything ahead with caution and follow directions on the packaging. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Complete with a 35.5-inch long metal clog remover, as well as six 25-inch sink drain snakes, this drain clog kit goes for just $8 on Amazon. And shoppers swear by the kit's ease of use and overall effectiveness in clearing up any clogs. So much so that many shoppers didn’t feel a need to call an expensive plumber and just did the job themselves.The kit also comes with two metal overflow brushes for clean up.Promising review: “Super useful for clearing our drains! We had a slow drain in our sink and shower, but using the orange snake, we were able to clear out a bunch of hair and not have to call a plumber. Saved us money and we can keep them for future use! I haven't used the claw snake, but I know just how handy that can be!” — Nathaniel Green Gobbler is an industrial strength drain clog remover that has a 4.3 out of 5 star rating on Amazon. This stuff is heavy duty, as it liquefies just about anything blocking your drain, such as hair, grease, toilet paper, soap scum, organic material, flushable wipes, and much more. Just pour it in still water in a blocked toilet, sink, shower, and tub, and let Green Gobbler do the rest.Promising review: “This enzyme did a great job of getting rid of a nasty sulfur smell in the bathroom sink. I used two treatments following the directions- 20 minutes didn't have an effect, but two hours did the trick combined with removing and cleaning the sink stopper. Very relieved to have a resolution without calling the plumber! I had meant to order the odor control version rather than the unclogging, but it had the same effect and I'll be glad to have this on hand to try on any future clogs. I do wish a smaller size was available but, again, I'm sure it'll come in handy in the future.” — Nat You could also replace your drain stopper altogether with the Mer-Maid Drain Magic stopper. It’s a clever two-in-one rust-proof drain plug that seals up a sink drain when you need to fill it with water for a shave or hand-washing clothes, and it also functions an anti-clog device that catches grime and hair before it becomes a problem. Just push it down to seal and push it again to drain. It’s easy to use and install, as it fits over most standard bathroom sink drains.Promising review: “It’s really easy to install and looks great. My only complaint is the water around it doesn’t all go down the drain. But that easy to fix by lifting it out for a second. I did test to see if it kept water in place one night till morning. It did work perfectly. It is nice to have my sink work again so easily and not pay plumber prices. The three different size washers makes it fit my sink perfectly too.” — K.M. These drain field cleaner tablets promise to clear out just about organic clogs and sludge from septic tanks and drains to make it easier to get to the source of any blockage. Just add a tablet to still water in a sink, tub, or toilet, wait for clogs to dissolve, and then flush out the blockage for a working drain. It also eliminates bad odors from a clogged drain.Promising review: “Try this root destroyer to keep the lines clear of roots and dirt, septic treatment and accelerator to speed up the process- all three products every 3 months depending upon the size of your family. It has kept me from calling a plumber.” — latondavis The AquaPlumb plumbers putty provides a water-tight seal that prevents leaks, and it’s super malleable to take the shape of where it’s needed the most. Think of it as Play-Doh, but for fixing leaks in bathrooms and kitchens. The plumber's putty is ideal for kitchen sinks, bathroom tubs, toilets, fountains, garbage disposals, and more.Promising review: “I replaced a tub pop-up drain assembly. This plumbers putty was pliant and readily did the job. I don't have a big need to use this product often, but it was perfect for my DIY project. Arrived safely and timely, well packaged.” — T. Paine The Drain Weasel is a hybrid clog remover and drain snake in one long 18-inch tool that’s easy to use and effective for clearing and unclogging drains in your bathroom and kitchen. Just place it into a clogged drain, spin it around to collect any hair or grime, and then pull it out to release the obstruction from the pipe.Promising review: “I was skeptical but it cleared out my bathroom sink fast and efficiently. Very good product to use on your drains without having to call a Plumber. I don't know if it would work on a heavy duty clog. It worked well for snaking hair out of my bathroom sink that stopped draining. Cleared it all out. Very pleased.” — Lisa Marie Is your kitchen garbage disposal starting to slow down and get gnarly? These garbage disposal cleaner drops help clean and deodorize funky disposals as they eliminate smells and clear drains. Each drop deep cleans and breaks up any smelly fats, oils, and food particles in a kitchen garbage disposal to leave it as safe, fresh, and clean as possible. Just add one to your garbage disposal and it works in about 15 seconds or so. Then just run water to clear away residue.Promising review: “This actually worked as promised. Saved a plumber bill for sure.” — B. Harral Every sink in your home needs a drain plunger underneath it, just in case you have a stubborn clog that has to be cleared away. This drain plunger — which is on sale for $14.99, or nearly 15% off its list price — is small, lightweight, and surprisingly powerful, as it’s a very popular one on Amazon. It earned a 4.5 out of 5-star rating from more than 27,000 shoppers and is designed to clear blockages in mere seconds. Promising review: “Before calling a plumber to clear my bathtub drain, I decided to order this plunger. Wow, after seven months of a clogged drain, it worked immediately. Try it, you'll love it.” — Karina Why wait to deal with a clogged drain when you can prevent one? This drain protector fits in most standard bathroom sinks, catching hair and grime before it becomes a problem down the line. Once full, just lift the protector out of the drain and dispose of the detritus, so your drain remains clear and you don’t have to call a plumber for help.Promising review: “Our bathroom sink was taking forever to drain. Eventually we checked the pipes and they were backed up with whatever goes down the drain. This sink shroom has prevented build up of hair and floss in the pipe for months now and our sink is draining perfectly. It’s super easy to clean, you just pull it out and remove whatever is caught in the catch, and replace it back in the sink. We were so close to calling a plumber but with a little elbow grease and some ingenuity we could avoid it. The price is right and it matches the finishings on the sink.” — Denali By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "CNN Cuts About 200 Jobs As Part Of A Further Shift To Digital Business",
    "text": "CNN announced a restructuring Thursday that includes some 200 layoffs, an accelerated pivot to digital operations and new TV roles for personalities like Wolf Blitzer, Jake Tapper and Audie Cornish. It’s the boldest revamp yet in the 18-month tenure of CEO Mark Thompson, a former chief executive at The New York Times and BBC called upon by parent company Warner Bros. Discovery to revive the news outlet’s flagging fortunes. The layoffs are concentrated in CNN’s TV business, where ratings have tumbled as consumers cut off cable and seek other news sources. They will eventually be offset by new hires in digital, where Warner Bros. Discovery is making a $70 million investment, CNN said. “This is not a cost-saving exercise,” Thompson said in an interview. “We’re actually leaning in with increased investments.” Layoffs have either taken place or are anticipated across the news industry. CNN’s ratings have taken a hit since the election of President Donald Trump, a longtime critic of the network. CNN averaged 1.7 million viewers for Trump’s inauguration this week, compared to 8 million for Joe Biden’s inaugural four years ago, though audience can fluctuate based on the political stance of the person being inaugurated. CNN also took a financial hit — how much is unclear — when a Florida jury last week found the network liable for defaming a U.S. Navy veteran on a story involving a paid effort to extract endangered Afghans following their country’s Taliban takeover. The network settled the case before the jury could fully decide damages. CNN announced Thursday it was developing a product that would allow consumers to watch a TV-like video stream on any device, although it won’t be TV simulcast. There was no estimated launch date. Under Thompson, CNN has quietly redesigned and offered new features on its CNN.com website. Late last year, it instituted a $3.99 monthly and $29.99 yearly subscription for its heaviest users, and is working on new online products in areas like lifestyle, weather and sports. In some respects, Thompson is trying to do for CNN what he did at the Times, where its digital products modernized the newspaper’s business. Executives are hoping CNN’s video component and international presence offers growth opportunities that won’t duplicate the Times. CNN’s transformation “isn’t and can’t be a single set of changes but a process of investment, experimentation and adaptation that will last years,” Thompson said in a memo to CNN staff. “Our objective is a simple one: to shift CNN’s gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting.” CNN is looking for savings in television with a leaner staff and a transfer of some of its technical operations to its Atlanta office. The network announced a series of schedule changes: veteran anchor Blitzer’s “Situation Room” will move from the evening to 10 a.m. Eastern, where he will be joined by Pamela Brown; Tapper’s two-hour show will now begin at 5 p.m.; Cornish will host “CNN This Morning” beginning at 6 a.m.; Kasie Hunt will host a new show, “The Arena,” at 4 p.m.; and Rahel Solomon will do a show, “5 Things,” at 5 a.m. Left out for now is current late morning host Jim Acosta, a frequent Trump sparring partner during the president’s first term. He’s negotiating a new role, CNN said, after he reportedly balked at a late-night assignment. Besides cord-cutting, the television network’s biggest challenge is reaching Trump supporters who consider the network enemy territory. Many supporters, in fact, went online Thursday to express glee at the thought of layoffs there. “Not only is Trump stronger than he’s ever been in his political career, he may well have killed legacy media as we know it,” radio host and OutKick founder Clay Travis wrote on X. Thompson said he wanted CNN to distinguish itself with hard-hitting journalism and fact-checking to let viewers make up their own minds on issues. He noted Abby Phillip’s prime-time program as one of the few in cable news that allows people with widely divergent views to debate issues.

    "title": "Colin Jost Reveals How That Wild Vagina Joke About Wife Scarlett Johansson Went Over",
    "text": "“SNL” star Colin Jost is finally sharing how that racy “Weekend Update” joke in December went over with his wife, Scarlett Johansson, whose vagina he compared on-air to a roast beef sandwich from Costco — to raucous laughter from the audience and himself alike. “Scarlett was genuinely so shocked,” Jost told Jimmy Fallon on Monday’s “Tonight Show.” The recurring segment in which Jost and his co-star Michael Che write jokes for each other — and then have to read them aloud no matter what — left Jost as stunned as his wife, who was backstage during the broadcast and reacted with a facial expression for the ages. “I was obviously surprised by everything, but they gave her a heads-up,” Jost told Fallon. “They were like, ‘Hey, would you be OK if Michael made a little, like, kind of vagina joke at some point?’ And she was like, ‘Sure!’ You know, ‘Whatever, I’m open to it.’” “I didn’t know where it was going, and then the graphic came up for [Costco],” he continued, prompting audible laughs of recognition from the audience. “So Scarlett is backstage like, ’Oh my God! That’s what it is?!” The premise of the joke in question concerned Costco removing its roast beef sandwich from its menu, and with an image of the meal appearing onscreen behind Jost, he said at the time: “But I ain’t tripping, I be eating roast beef every night since my wife had the kid.” Jost and Johansson tied the knot in 2020 and welcomed their son, Cosmo, in 2021. Johansson, who mouthed an apparent “Oh my God” from backstage after Jost delivered the R-rated dig, previously admitted that the joke swaps are “brutal” and get “worse” every year — and joked that she blacks out “for that period of the night” every time.

The Marvel actor nonetheless understands that this is all just comedy, however, and praised her husband on “Live with Kelly and Mark” last year as “a very, very, very great guy.” “I’m extremely lucky,” Johansson said at the time. “He’s a kind person and he’s hilarious and thoughtful and loving and he’s a great dad and I love him. I feel very, very lucky. But he’s also, he’s got his naughty side.

    "title": "This Highly Rated Chair Cushion Helps With My Sciatica — And It's Less Than $50",
    "text": "HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Prior to working from home consistently, I seldom experienced body pains aside from the occasional backache after a bad night’s rest. But switching to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted in me developing a rather irritating condition called sciatica, which refers to radiating pain felt in the lower back all the way down to the feet. After numerous doctor visits, I was recommended one source of relief in the form of a portable seat cushion I could put on my office chair at home. And right now, you can get the best one I’ve tried for just $45 on Amazon. I’ve tested out a ton of seat cushions that claim to provide sciatica and back pain relief, but ComfiLife’s gel enhanced cushion is by far the supreme winner for me — and is further proved by the nearly 60,000 five-star reviews on Amazon. This is my second year using it, and honestly, I’m due for a replacement, but that just speaks to how much of a life-changer it’s been for me. It fits perfectly on my chair and when I’m traveling, I can just pick it up and take it wherever I go. In fact, I love it so much that I bought my mom one for her birthday last year — she unfortunately experiences sciatica, too — and she keeps hers in her car for long drives. What makes this ergonomically designed cushion better than others I’ve tried is that it’s made of gel memory foam and has a cooling gel layer on top for added relief. The outer cover is also machine-washable so you don’t have to worry about it being destroyed if you accidentally spill coffee on it, like I’ve done. It also has an anti-slip bottom so it won’t slide around while you’re sitting. Plus, in addition to its structure giving maximum support while reducing pressure on your tailbone, it also promotes a better sitting posture. But if my pain relief testimony doesn’t move you, let these glowing reviews on Amazon do the rest of the talking: “I went on a trip and drove approx. 3,500 miles over 11 days, and used this cushion. My wife used one on the passenger’s seat. Both provided comfort and prevented my lower back/sciatica from being irritated from sitting for up to 7 hours. I recommend this cushion for anyone with lower back issues complicated by sitting/driving long periods of time.” — Tim S. “I have been living with recurring sciatica for over a decade and this product has made a world of difference in my day-to-day quality of life. I used to get flare ups of sciatic nerve pain when sitting in traffic for long periods of time. I took this with me on a 3-day road trip from California to Texas and had ZERO sciatica symptoms the whole time. If you struggle with lower back pain, treat yourself to this cushion! It is worth every penny.” — Cristina Tangreti “I WFH and sit for 9 hours a day. This is perfect! I don’t have to scoot/twitch/move constantly and my butt and back pain has been relieved. I’ve told many colleagues about this must have product. I always struggle with lower back pain and this has made life much more bearable!” — Joanna By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "This All-Time Favorite Korean Skin Serum Is On Sale But Definitely Not For Long",
    "text": "HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Even before the Cosrx Snail 96 Essence reached TikTok-fame status, I’d long sworn by its ability to transform my parched and sensitive skin into a complexion that’s supple and glowing — presumably thanks to snail secretion filtrate, an ingredient that does in fact come from snails. People in need of hydrated skin have caught on, causing the slimy-sounding product to sell out left and right. It’s even made special appearances on HuffPost’s own editor’s pick lists and several skin care stories. Now, you can try the serum for yourself (or stock up) for 33% off at Amazon right now with this special three-piece set that includes two bottles of essence and one sample of the brand’s 0.1% retinol cream. Before you wrinkle your nose at the idea of rubbing snail secretion on your face, know that snail mucin has reportedly been used for cosmetic purposes since the ’80s in Chile when snail farmers noticed their skin seemed softer, and cuts seemed to heal faster, when in contact with the snails. It then became popular in the Korean and Japanese beauty markets. Cosrx, the beloved Korean skin care brand, packs an over-96% concentration of the stuff into their serum. (Popular snail mucin products like Mizon’s Snail Repair contain 80% and Iunik Black Snail Restore just 70%.) According to Cosrx, snail mucin is nutrient-rich byproduct compatible with all skin types that can help improve a damaged skin barrier by offering deep hydration. This can help contribute to a more plump and glowing complexion, and there’s also some research to support the claim that secretion filtrate can promote wound healing and possibly improve the appearance of fine lines. Aside from a blend of six different snail filtrates, this potent formulation also contains allantoin, which is considered to have anti-irritation properties and is great for sensitive or irritated skin. If you’re wondering how it feels, it’s not the slimy, sticky goop that you’re probably imagining. The fragrance-free serum feels surprisingly lightweight on the skin, is fast-absorbing and even layers well underneath my other nighttime skin care products. I typically apply it to freshly toned or damp skin, then follow up with a retinol and moisturizer. Take advantage of the Cosrx snail serum starter pack sale at the button below or keep scrolling to read some promising reviews from buyers on Amazon. Promising Amazon reviews: ″I have oily/combination skin. I just got off of Accutane a few months ago and have been using tretinoin every few days only with using a simple face wash and moisturizer every morning and night. I use this on nights I am not using tretinoin. I added this into my routine and have been using it 3-4 nights a week for a few weeks. I realllyy enjoy it. I use it after I wash and before I moisturize before sleeping and it makes my skin look glowy and reduces my hyperpigmentation. In the morning, my skin looks hydrated and supple, and I really haven’t had any issues. I think it is helping with scarring and some acne that pops up, but I think it is too early for me to say that with 100% certainty.” — grayce (This review has been edited for length.) “This is my second purchase of this product and I’m absolutely addicted to it! I bought it because of how many reviews said it was so moisturizing, and oh my, they were so right. I use it every morning and night right after I wash my face and it’s been working great for me. I have combination skin that is mostly dry and if you have my skin type you already know about the flaking cheeks and an oily t-zone. This product also balanced my face out, so this happens less often! I cannot stress this enough how great this product is.” — Amelia “I have very sensitive eczema skin and have trouble finding skincare products that react well to my skin. The snail mucin did not make my skin flare up. It felt nice and cool on my face and didn’t leave a sticky residue. I noticed that my skin is less flakey now that I’ve added this to my routine. You skin need to use toner and moisturizer since this alone will not do much. Definitely recommend!” — Yeng Chang By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Cynthia Erivo Says ‘Wicked’ Fans Keep Approaching Her With A Surprising Gesture",
    "text": "Cynthia Erivo may be casting spells with her performance in the movie “Wicked,” but fans are still finding ways to take her by surprise. Taking a brief break from the enchanted land of Oz, Erivo visited “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Tuesday. During the segment, Kimmel asked about the actor’s legendary “war cry” riff from the film’s hit song, “Defying Gravity.” Kimmel was curious if fans imitate the “war cry” at her. Erivo’s response? “Yes. Randomly. When I don’t ask for it.” “Do they intro it?” Kimmel asked. No, Erivo said — “Wicked” fans sometimes “go straight into” the song without a hint of warning. She admitted that she is still trying to figure out how to react to these spontaneous outpourings of love. “Sometimes it’s really delightful. Sometimes it’s really really wonderful,” she said. “I think what’s lovely is that people are willing to try anyway.” The three-time Grammy winner confessed that while it’s a little bewitching when fans imitate her performance, she’s touched that their “emotion” is so powerful that they can’t help but burst into song without even introducing themselves.

Mariann Edgar Budde’s calling out of Donald Trump — to the president’s face, during a sermon earlier this week — got the montage treatment from “The Daily Show.” The Comedy Central program on Thursday cut clips of the Episcopal Bishop of Washington’s calm and measured plea to Trump that he have “mercy” on those people his policies may harm alongside footage of Fox News hosts and talking heads responding to her. Sean Hannity ranted about Budde’s “far-left woke tirade.” Laura Ingraham claimed Trump had been “forced to listen to the rantings of a lunatic.” And others likened Budde’s comments to “discarded propaganda” and ripped her as “arrogant” and a “heretic.” Watch the video here: Blessed are the meek?

    "title": "Meta Names UFC's Dana White, A Close Trump Ally, To Its Board",
    "text": "Dana White, the president and CEO of UFC and longtime friend of President-elect Donald Trump, is among the new people appointed to Meta’s board of directors, the company announced Monday. “I’ve never been interested in joining a board of directors until I got the offer to join Meta’s board. I am a huge believer that social media and AI are the future,” White said in a statement. The UFC CEO, who’s been involved with the mixed martial arts promotion company since 2001, has endorsed Trump in all three of his presidential campaigns and introduced him at last year’s Republican National Convention, calling him “the toughest, most resilient human being that I’ve ever met in my life.” White has also been credited with aiding Trump’s appeal to young male voters ― one of the key demographics that helped him best Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Despite the role he played, White has dismissed the possibility of having a role in Trump’s administration and expressed some frustration with politics in the weeks after the election. “I’m never fucking doing this again,” White told The New Yorker. “I want nothing to do with this shit. It’s gross.” “It’s disgusting,” he continued. “I want nothing to do with politics.” White is also friendly with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The two have posed for Instagram photos together, and White has consulted the tech titan on implementing more AI into UFC. White’s appointment is the latest example of Zuckerberg cozying up to Trump and his allies, underscoring the broader tech industry’s efforts to play nice with the incoming administration. In late November, Zuckerberg met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago. It’s unclear what they discussed, but Zuckerberg reportedly initiated the meeting, according to The New York Times. Meta is also among the companies that donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. The company did not donate to Trump’s first inauguration or to President Joe Biden’s in 2021. News of White’s appointment comes a few days after Zuckerberg named Republican Joel Kaplan, a former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, as Meta’s head of policy.

    "text": "CNN fact-checking reporter Daniel Dale on Monday drew a sharp distinction between the “smattering” of untruths told by Donald Trump during the president’s second inauguration address and his return to his “familiar lie-a-minute style” in a later “unscripted” speech to prominent supporters. “Honestly, there was not a ton to fact-check” about Trump’s official speech, Dale admitted to CNN colleague Jake Tapper. However, Dale then exposed some of the “nonsense” that Trump had parroted in his subsequent speech ― such as his false claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him and that his opponents tried to rig the 2024 vote too. Trump’s exaggerations of his win in Alabama, the number of miles of the southern border wall that he was responsible for building and his unproven allegations that “jails of every country in the world” are being emptied into the United States also came under intense scrutiny from Dale.

    "title": "'SNL': Dave Chappelle Reflects On Jimmy Carter's 'Empathy' Ahead Of Trump Inauguration",
    "text": "“Saturday Night Live” host Dave Chappelle used a lengthy opening monologue to remind Americans of former President Jimmy Carter’s “empathy” just days before Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Monday. The controversial comedian, who sat for the majority of his monologue, rose from his stool to remark on the recent death of Carter, noting that he isn’t qualified to say whether he was a “bad” or “good” president in his lifetime. He then turned to Carter’s visit to Israel around the release of his 2006 book, “Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,” noting that the Israeli government warned him that it was “too dangerous” for him to go to Palestine on the trip. “And man, Jimmy Carter went anyway. I will never forget the images of a former American president walking with little to no security while thousands of Palestinians were cheering him on,” Chappelle said. “And when I saw that picture, it brought tears to my eyes,” he added. “I said, ‘I don’t know if that’s a good president, but that right there, I am sure, is a great man.’ It made me feel very proud.” Earlier in the monologue, Chappelle, whose transphobic jokes have sparked controversy in recent years, declared that he was “tired” of being controversial as he noted that it was “way too soon” to joke about the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. But after winking to the crowd and pausing for laughter, he took aim at people commenting on the celebrities who have lost their homes amid the fires, claiming that some have said, “Yeah, it serves these celebrities right” and “I hope the houses burned down.” “You see that? That right there, that’s why I hate poor people,” Chappelle quipped. “Because they can’t see past their own pain.” At the end of his monologue, Chappelle tied both the fires and Carter’s visit together as he sent a message to President-elect Trump. “The presidency is no place for petty people,” said Chappelle, who notably hosted the first “SNL” episode after Trump’s 2016 election win and the show following Joe Biden’s election win back in 2020. “So, Donald Trump, I know you watch the show. Man, remember, whether people voted for you or not, they’re all counting on you,” he continued. “Whether they like you or not, the whole world is counting on you.” “And I mean this when I say this. Good luck. Please, do better next time. Please, all of us, do better next time,” he added. “Do not forget your humanity, and please have empathy for displaced people, whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine.” Check out more of Chappelle’s “SNL” monologue below.

    "title": "Dave Grohl Reveals Nirvana's 'SNL' Debut Nearly Ended In 'Titanic-Level Disaster'",
    "text": "Nirvana’s debut “Saturday Night Live” performance was a perfect introduction to the grunge genre for untold viewers watching live on Jan. 11, 1992, but it nearly ended in a “Titanic-level disaster,” drummer Dave Grohl revealed in a new documentary Monday. “Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music,” directed by Oscar-winning documentarian Questlove of The Roots, chronicles the triumphs, pranks and accidents that have befallen musical guests on the iconic NBC show — with Nirvana’s debut arguably near the top. Grohl recalled being “absolutely fucking terrified” when they arrived at “SNL” four months after their debut studio album, “Nevermind,” was released, and said in “50 Years” that he got even more nervous when the crew counted them down for their live performance. “The room gets dead silent,” the Foo Fighters frontman said. “Your heart is racing and you’re thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m gonna faint, I’m gonna puke on live television, I’m gonna die.’ And, typically, what happens if I get nervous, I beat the shit out of the drums twice as hard.” While that performance anxiety certainly helped him launch into “Smells Like Teen Spirit” with a vengeance when host Rob Morrow introduced the band, Grohl revealed that he “snapped my snare stick in half” when they were “only like 20 seconds into the song.” Frontman Kurt Cobain gave no sign of noticing while belting out his lyrics. “I was hitting the drums 10 times harder than I’ve ever hit them before in my life,” Grohl admitted in the documentary. “There was one break right before the first drum roll, I think, where I grabbed another stick really quick and busted into it.” He continued, “I mean, it was so close to being, like, ‘Titanic’-level disaster.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The performance was ultimately anything but, as then-“SNL” cast member Adam Sandler testified in the documentary: “People were talking about it, getting more calls than you ever got before from friends in my hometown, just like, ‘What’s he like? What’s Kurt like?’” Cobain’s substance abuse issues eventually contributed to his suicide on April 5, 1994. Nirvana performed on “SNL” one last time on Sept. 25, 1993, months before Cobain died at the age of 27.

    "text": "Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes are jointly defending their former ABC News colleague David Muir, who has been hit with a flurry of criticism for cinching in his jacket while covering the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires. On the Jan. 10 episode of the iHeart podcast “Amy & T.J.,” Robach described Muir as a “consummate professional,” and shrugged off claims that his decision to adjust the fit of his outfit was motivated by “vanity.” “He cinched his jacket, as many of us have done in the field and on the set, to create a cleaner line,” she explained. “Television is a visual medium. So, yes, I have cinched my jacket.” Holmes echoed those sentiments. “The perspective might be missing if you’re just reading tweets,” he said. “Just a little context: The guy works his butt off. You don’t like what he did ― fine. It’s just a lot to be piled onto this.” Muir’s name began trending on social media on Wednesday of last week after an ABC News broadcast in which a clothespin was briefly visible on the back of his jacket, leading many to assume he’d wanted the garment to appear more form-fitting. It didn’t take long for the incident to catch the eye of a number of public figures, including reality TV personality Jack Osbourne and former Fox News host Megyn Kelly. Nice Jacket Bro. Glad you look nice and svelte with those clothes line pegs, while our city burns to the ground. @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/bGQ3zvF6lr “Nice Jacket Bro. Glad you look nice and svelte with those clothes line pegs, while our city burns to the ground,” Osbourne wrote on X, formerly Twitter. On her SiriusXM show, Kelly blasted Muir for his “abject vanity,” calling his jacket a “costume” and saying, “He’s in love with his own face, waistline and opinion, and it shows.” Muir has not commented publicly on his onscreen ensemble, but has not visibly worn clothespins in subsequent broadcasts. Robach and Holmes, former “Good Morning America” co-hosts, exited ABC News in early 2023, shortly after it was revealed that their relationship had gone from professional to romantic. Despite their defense of Muir personally, the former anchors pushed back on an explanation offered by an ABC News source, who told the outlet Mediaite that the veteran journalist’s jacket had been cinched to secure it against high winds. “I’ve never, ever pinned a jacket because of the wind,” Robach said. “That is simply a response that did not ring true for me and that was, I think, unfortunate, because that seemed like a desperate attempt to explain away something that we all know the truth to. He ― or someone ― wanted his jacket to not be as boxy for whatever reason.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "David Schwimmer Ticked Off 'Saturday Night Live' Writers And Had No Idea Why",
    "text": "David Schwimmer said Monday he got a hostile reception from “Saturday Night Live” writers when he appeared on the comedy show decades ago ― and for a long time, he didn’t know why. (Watch the video below.) It was October 1995. Fame was blooming for Schwimmer and his castmates, but it was Schwimmer who became the first to host the comedy sketch series. He shot an episode of “Friends” in Los Angeles on Tuesday night ― as they did back in the day ― and arrived in New York on Thursday ready to prepare for the live “SNL” show. “When I walked into the writer’s room, the entire writing staff looked at me as if I had just slept with their mom or something,” he told host Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show.” “They were not happy to see me, and I had no idea.” The actor said he got through the short week and live broadcast while “traumatized.” “It wasn’t until years later that I was talking to somebody else who hosted the show and they said no, you’re supposed to show up on a Monday,” he said. “No one told me.” Schwimmer said he would “try not to blame all my reps” for the “one big mistake.” The “Goosebumps: The Vanishing” actor fast-forwarded to present day, saying he’d received an email inviting him to the 50th anniversary special of “SNL” in February. “It’s been 30 years, and I’m thinking maybe they forgot that they don’t like me, or it’s just some intern that’s tasked with emailing everyone who’s ever hosted. But I don’t know what to do,” Schwimmer confessed. After some back and forth, it appears the actor might attend with Northwestern University pal Colbert, who briefly worked as a freelance “SNL” writer, as his plus-one.

    "title": "GOP Senator's Husband Snubs Harris' Handshake During Swearing-In Ceremony",
    "text": "The husband of a Republican senator refused to shake Vice President Kamala Harris’ hand during his wife’s swearing-in ceremony on Friday, as seen in a now-viral video that captured the awkward exchange. Sen. Deb Fischer (R.-Neb.) appeared to be all smiles while being sworn in by Harris for her third term in the U.S. Senate while standing alongside her husband, Bruce Fischer. The moment appeared to turn frosty, however, as the senator repeatedly nudged her husband to stand closer to the vice president as he held a cane with one hand and a Bible in the other. The husband of a Republican senator just refused to shake hands or make eye contact with Vice President Harris.The level of class you can expect from MAGA. pic.twitter.com/hTarflIqlw “It’s OK, I won’t bite. I’m not going to bite. Don’t worry,” a smiling Harris is heard telling him as he appears to avert his gaze and keep his eyes on the Bible. Deb Fischer shook Harris’ hand after completing her oath and thanked the vice president. When Harris expressed congratulations to the senator’s husband, he offered a short “thank you” and then dropped his newly freed left hand and put it in his pants pocket, prompting a raised-eyebrows reaction from Harris. The senator shared photos of the event on her social media account along with a pledge about continuing to stand together.

    "title": "Demi Moore’s Golden Globes Speech Made Me Realize Something Unexpected About Myself",
    "text": "When Demi Moore, 62, took the stage at the Golden Globes ceremony to accept her first major acting award in her 40-year career for the movie “The Substance,” her speech resonated with me. Moore said she used to measure her worth based on other people’s expectations and that a producer had referred to her as a “popcorn actress.” “And I bought in, and I believed that,” she said, implying she thought the producer was right and that she would never amount to anything meaningful as an actor because someone else had told her so. But, toward the end of her speech, these words stuck with me: “When we don’t think we’re smart enough, or skinny enough, or successful enough, or basically just enough, just know: You will never be enough,” she said. “But you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.” At that moment, and I’m sure many women felt this way, it was as though she was talking directly to me. For decades, I’d also defaulted to seeking outward approval and acceptance to meet others’ expectations of what it meant to be enough — instead of focusing on my own feelings and thoughts. That is, until I reached my 40s. Like Moore, I struggled to be “enough” for everything and everyone at an early age. At 13, I became obsessed with trying to make my breasts — a dismal A cup — appear larger. Every morning before school, I’d grab a wad of tissues and stuff them inside my training bra in an attempt to fill it out. I stood in the mirror before zipping up my coat, admiring the artificial curves I’d created. For a moment, I thought, maybe I could be pretty like the other girls in class and in the movies. But that sensation of relief in my gut didn’t last. This was around the 1990s and early 2000s when there was a lot of speculation in the media that Moore had gotten breast implants before starring in movies like “Indecent Proposal” and then “Striptease” a few years later. In a September 2024 interview with The New York Times podcast, she recalled being “extremely shamed” for her choice to portray a stripper, despite receiving a salary of $12.5 million, which was considerable for a woman at that time. “Well, with ‘Striptease,’ it was as if I had betrayed women, and with ‘G.I. Jane,’ it was as if I had betrayed men,” Moore said in the interview. “I think anyone who had been in the position that was the first to get that kind of equality of pay would probably have taken a hit. But because I did a film that was dealing with the world of stripping and the body, I was extremely shamed.” In high school, as I grew into my body, I longed to be “skinny enough.” I wanted to be liked by the cool kids, so I joined the cheerleading squad. I also felt judged by my real friends — who were creatives in drama, music, art and writing — for revealing too much of my body. Despite a sinking feeling that something felt off before every football game, I put on my ill-fitting blue skirt that tugged at my waist and kept performing. I stared in the mirror, making a checklist of all the things wrong with my body — my barely there breasts, awkward-shaped knees, my pale, chubby cheeks and protruding belly. I hated what I saw. I thought I’d never look like the other girls on the squad, the ones with long legs and perfect proportions. It made me uncomfortable calling attention to myself, but I wanted to be accepted, so I cheered. But inside, I was screaming to escape. One evening after cheerleading practice, my coach, who wore her dark hair in a high ponytail and skinny jeans, scanned me with her eyes from head to toe. It was a silent gesture that my body wasn’t meeting her expectations. I closed my eyes, wishing I could be someone else. I was not skinny enough for her. Moore craved body acceptance, too. She shared her battles with her self-image as she rose to fame in her 2019 memoir, “Inside Out.” In the late ’90s, after a producer told Moore to lose weight, she began obsessively exercising and dieting. In a 2019 interview with Women’s Health magazine, Moore said about her mindset, “All I could think about was my body, my body.” When I started college, I began battling with myself about my weight. I’d gone well over the “freshman 15” that people had warned me about. I tried different methods to manage it. I binged bowl after bowl of cereal in the dining hall at school until my stomach felt heavy, like wet cement. I’d rush back to my dorm bathroom before my roommate returned from class and press my index finger to the back of my throat, releasing the contents of my meal. That didn’t last long; I couldn’t bear the smell of vomit that filled my nose, despite spraying Lysol to disguise the nasty stench. Weeks after draining my stomach daily, I tried other methods. I ate a bowl of pasta and then ran for an hour and half, fighting the cramps that came on at every turn from overeating. I thought if I exercised enough, purged enough, maybe I could eventually be skinny enough. Then, I fasted for hours at a time, forgoing breakfast and lunch. I’d walk into frat parties feeling thin, grab the red plastic cup filled with Coors Light and toss it back. It burned as it sank to the bottom of my empty gut. I dressed in tube tops and low-cut jeans with heels, thinking that was what it meant to be beautiful like the women in magazines. I scanned the room, looking for approval that I was worthy, constantly wondering what other people thought of me and if I’d ever be enough. In my 20s, I was in a constant state of self-loathing; my self-worth began to suffer. I longed to be “smart enough.” Like Moore succumbing to the belief that she’d always be a “popcorn actress” who would never be recognized for the meaningful roles she played, I also began to believe the criticism from those around me. “For so long, my perception was that if someone else said I wasn’t skinny enough, smart enough or successful enough, it was true and that was it.” In my first office job, I worked in business development for a screen printing company. A few weeks in, my boss called me into his office to talk about my performance. I could feel the sweat pooling under my button-down shirt. I worried it would soak through and become visible. He looked past me, at the white cement wall behind me, as though I wasn’t there. “I just think you should pursue other jobs. Maybe you aren’t cut out for this. I’m going to have to let you go,” he said. I felt sick. I’d never been fired before. I believed him and convinced myself that I was a failure. My mind raced, thinking of questions to ask. How could I do my job better? Would he reconsider? After that, I began allowing other people’s opinions of me to outweigh my own, making me question my worth. In conversations, I would hear myself talking, doubting the words as they came out of my mouth. I didn’t know who I was anymore. The vicious cycle of overthinking my relationships and my self-worth continued for years. Like Moore, I was desperate to be recognized for my achievements and to be “successful enough.” I thought if others saw me this way, I’d finally feel revered and accepted. Years later, in my communications job, I was the first to the office at 6:30 a.m., ate lunch at my desk, never took breaks and was the last one to leave at 7 p.m. My grueling work paid off; I even won small awards, all the while questioning if I liked what I was doing. I felt conflicted. I couldn’t decide if I was doing it all for myself or for someone else. Moore’s own struggle to be successful went on for years, and was especially noticeable in the physical and mental challenge of her role in “G.I. Jane,” where she played a woman who was training to become a Navy SEAL. It wasn’t until my mid-30s, when I began seeing a psychologist specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), that my perspective about myself finally changed for the better. During that time, I learned more about myself: to let go of others’ opinions of me and to accept my body and myself as I was. CBT taught me to change my response to triggering situations that caused me to be critical of my body, my worth and my achievements. Before therapy, when someone would criticize me, I’d take it personally and it would impact my self-worth. I’d tell my therapist, “They said I’m a failure.” To which he’d say, “No, they said you are not good at one thing, that doesn’t make you a failure.” I would take negative comments to the extreme and to heart as a form of rejection. For so long, my perception was that if someone else said I wasn’t skinny enough, smart enough or successful enough, it was true and that was it. But that wasn’t the case. My therapist made me realize that I could control my response and that what mattered most was my own thoughts about myself. Like Moore, therapy helped me to begin the process of healing. My therapist told me, “Although you can’t control the thought coming into your mind, you can change your response to it.” Learning this technique allowed me to build more confidence in myself. In her memoir, Moore revealed she also went through CBT (along with other forms of addiction rehab) after years of struggling with her body image, disordered eating and questioning her self-worth, and said it helped her improve her life. After spending years trying to be “enough” to meet everyone else’s expectations, I thought it would bring me happiness, success and beauty. Instead, it brought years of shame, sadness and isolation. Now, at 45, I no longer internalize comments and weigh other’s opinions over my own. I’ve learned to factor their guidance to help me make the choices that work best for me and to embrace growth and change, while still being my own person that I’m proud of. The people I surround myself with help me feel validated in my experiences. Moore, too, has found that value in her life, as a mother to three daughters, becoming a role model for them. As a mother myself, I feel more connected and in tune with my own decisions than ever before. I’ve found that being kinder to myself, prioritizing my well-being and choosing quality friends — the ones who see me for who I am — has made me feel happier and more fulfilled. Looking back, I realized that like Moore, I have something now that I didn’t have at a younger age: confidence in who I am, what I look like and where I’m going in life. I now have the self-awareness to know when I need to step back from something that isn’t working for me. I’ve come to a place of honoring what I want and need, first and foremost. I’ve learned to trust myself, and I’ve finally stopped comparing myself to other people’s ideas of what beauty and success look like. “I always felt like I needed someone else to make me feel whole, but I learned the hard way that acceptance had to start with me, not anyone else,” Moore said in her memoir. I, too, have found that place within me to put down the measuring stick. At the conclusion of Moore’s speech, she said, “I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me and for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Fans Defend Demi Moore After Awkward Golden Globes Moment With Kylie Jenner",
    "text": "Demi Moore’s daughter is not going to let the online gossip mill steal her mom’s shine. On Sunday, after the “Substance” star won her first major acting award at the 82nd Golden Globes, footage began bubbling up on social media that ― according to some people ― appeared to show Moore snubbing Kylie Jenner at the ceremony. In the video, which was originally posted on the Golden Globes’ official TikTok account, an elated Moore can be seen hugging actor Elle Fanning, who is sitting next to Jenner. Moore begins to talk excitedly with Fanning, as Jenner looks on. At one point, Jenner appears to congratulate Moore, and Moore briefly acknowledges her before turning back to Fanning to continue their conversation. Moore then notices Jenner’s date, actor Timothée Chalamet, sitting on the other side of Jenner. She greets Chalamet warmly and begins talking to him, essentially passing Jenner over. Spotted 👀 Demi Moore celebrating her win at the GoldenGlobes! Another video posted to X, formerly Twitter, shows the exchange between Chalamet and Moore from a slightly different angle. You can see the Kylie Cosmetics founder nervously playing with her hair and excitedly clutching her phone — perhaps in anticipation of getting a selfie with Moore — but eventually looking down in apparent defeat as Moore walks away. Some social media users were outraged by the maybe-snub, while others delighted in it. Kylie TRIED to get included there bahahahaha Demi was like \"NOPE\" 🤣🤣 Demi's like 'I ain't got time for that,' and I'm here for it. Slay, queen I have second hand embarrassment What's wrong with Demi Moore? Like, it's okay that you don't want to engage in conversation with someone, but you say hello just to be polite. I felt bad for Kylie, she still tried to tell her something and the chick ignored her Demi Moore ignoring Kylie Jenner on purpose is simply manerless. You're in a public social setting. Direct cut, skipping someone on purpose to prove your disdain proves much more of Demi than of Kylie. Clasless and crass. You're in a gown and behave like a clown. But after the video went viral, Moore’s youngest daughter, Tallulah Willis, wasn’t about to let this narrative overshadow her mom’s achievement, and lovingly defended her in an Instagram Story. In Willis’ post, there is a screenshot of a social media post by the outlet Too Fab, whose caption reads: “Did Demi Moore snub Kylie Jenner? That’s what some are saying after THIS seeing this video.” Accompanying the screenshot, Willis wrote in overlaying text that she was “nipping” this whole story “straight in the bud.” “We spent new year with Elle, so connecting with her after a win was a very organic thing to do, this angel was in total shock and delight and moving throughout a warm room of well wishers,” Willis wrote of her mother. “There was not snub of any sort, had she seen KJ wanting to congratulate her she would have fully given her the time and space,” Willis added. “Literally just give it all a break and let a gal enjoy her accomplishments!” For what it’s worth, plenty of social media users didn’t interpret the encounter as Moore being deliberately rude to Jenner: i think demi was just trying to make the rounds as quickly as possible. she’s campaigning for future roles as any good actor/businessman should! demi replied to kylie when she said congrats tho, stop with these baseless narratives She looked right at her and said “thank you” ???

    "title": "'Daily Show' Salutes Trump Over His 'Statesman'-Like Response To Los Angeles Wildfires",
    "text": "“The Daily Show” correspondent Desi Lydic on Wednesday offered a blunt reminder of Donald Trump’s “leadership during times of crisis” after he blamed the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles on California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). “Because while everyone else is deeply concerned with what’s going on in Los Angeles right now, Trump is handling the tragedy like the statesman that he is,” Lydic said of the president-elect’s response to the wildfires, which have wreaked havoc on multiple LA neighborhoods and killed at least five people. Trump, in a rant shared to his Truth Social platform Wednesday, referred to the governor as “Newscum” before accusing him of mismanaging California’s water by refusing to let “millions of gallons of water” flow to “many parts” of the state. Trump’s blame game on social media got a chorus of boos from “The Daily Show” crowd before Lydic chimed in. “In the midst of chaos, Donald Trump is taking action by opening up the strategic nickname reserves. Thank you, sir,” she said as she looked into the camera and sarcastically gave a salute. Check out more from “The Daily Show” below.

    "title": "DOJ To Release Special Counsel Jack Smith's Findings In Trump Jan. 6 Probe",
    "text": "Special counsel Jack Smith’s highly anticipated report on his charging decisions in Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, election subversion case will be made public, federal prosecutors said Wednesday, but the same cannot be said of information underpinning Trump’s classified documents case. Details from that now-dismissed classified documents case should be held back from public view, federal prosecutors said Wednesday, because litigation is still underway in Florida against Trump’s valet and his Mar-a-Lago estate property manager. The disclosure was made in federal appellate court by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton in response to a recent request from Waltine Nauta, Trump’s valet, and Carlos De Oliveira, his property manager, to stop the publication entirely. Boynton said this was unnecessary. Smith, he wrote, already recommended to Attorney General Merrick Garland that to “avoid any risk of prejudice” to Nauta and De Oliveira, it would be best to release only information about the Jan. 6 charging decisions so long as criminal proceedings are pending against Nauta and De Oliveria. The report will, however, be available for private review by members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Lawyers for Nauta and De Oliveria have pushed for dismissal of their case by citing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed to investigate Trump. Smith, for his part, has appealed that ruling, and Boynton wrote in Wednesday’s motion that the special counsel’s appointment isn’t even relevant here. The only thing that matters is Garland’s “handling” of the report, Boynton wrote, adding that Cannon’s dismissal did not create a nationwide injunction on special counsels. In the meantime, Smith has followed department guidance by taking his findings to Garland and leaving it to him to decide whether the reports will go public. “That should be the end of the matter,” Boynton wrote. He continued: “To avoid the potential need for further emergency litigation in this Court, the United States respectfully requests that this Court make clear in denying the motion that its resolution of this question should be the last word (absent review by the en banc court or the Supreme Court).” On Tuesday, Cannon issued an order agreeing to temporarily block the release of the full two-volume report until the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reached a conclusion on Nauta and De Oliveria’s request to have it stopped. The Trump-appointed judge specified that her order would be in effect for at least three days until after the court made its decision or unless directed otherwise. “The heart of defendants’ claim for emergency injunctive relief is their assertion that ‘Attorney General Garland is certain to make [the Final Report] immediately public’ and thereby prejudice defendants in the event this Court reverses the dismissal of their indictments. But that prediction is incorrect. Attorney General Garland is committed to ensuring the integrity of the Department’s criminal prosecutions. Considering the risk of prejudice to defendants Nauta’s and De Oliveira’s criminal case, the Attorney General has agreed with the Special Counsel’s recommendation that Volume Two of the Final Report should not be publicly released while those cases remain pending,” Boyton wrote. “There is therefore no risk of prejudice to defendants and no basis for an injunction against the Attorney General.” As for any continued claims by Trump’s cohorts that Smith was unlawfully appointed, prosecutors urged the appellate court to disregard those theories and recognize that the district court in Florida “never barred” him from performing certain duties, generally speaking, like preparing the report. “Had it purported to do so, the district court would have had to grapple with the fact that the D.C. Circuit — whose law governs Department headquarters and the Special Counsel’s offices where the Final Report was prepared — has rejected the same Appointments Clause theory that the district court accepted,” Boyton wrote. “The district court with responsibility for the Election Case did so as well.” Even if everyone agreed that Smith’s appointment was made unconstitutionally, there would not be a “serious question,” the prosecutor wrote, that Garland at minimum had the statutory authority to hire Smith as a DOJ employee. The Supreme Court decided in 1976 that probe reports can be generated and prepared by individuals who are not appointed as officers of the U.S. if that individual performs tasks for the department that are both “investigative and informative.” The report’s release is purely up to Garland and does not depend on Smith’s appointment, Boyton added. In a response filed with the appellate court late Wednesday, lawyers for Nauta and De Oliveria have asked that the question be sent back to Cannon’s court for a hearing. This is necessary, they argue, because if the full report is disclosed to members of Congress, even with redactions, it could still be leaked, and if it were, there is nothing the court nor the executive branch could do to bind Congress. “There is no way to restrain members of Congress from disclosing their opinions regarding the report, or from disclosing the contents thereof. Nor is there a way to prohibit them from disclosing the materials to members of their staff, or to prevent members of their staff from then leaking the contents of the report ― or their prejudicial explanations. This country was founded on individual liberty, and those principles underlie the defense request. A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual’s right to a fair trial,” attorneys for Nauta and De Oliveira wrote. The attorneys said they are particularly worried that the report will not sufficiently redact grand jury information that was used to charge the men. It’s “not for the DOJ to decide what grand jury information must be protected from members of Congress,” and that discretion on that matter, they claim, is entirely up to the courts. “If any grand jury material is to be released to anyone not tasked with enforcing criminal laws, then there must be an adversarial hearing at which the district court determines if release is appropriate and what is appropriately released,” they argue. When Smith appealed Cannon’s decision to dismiss the case because Smith was unlawfully appointed, federal prosecutors argued her order deviated from logic and legal precedent. The judge’s “contrary view,” Smith wrote in his appeal in August, conflicted directly with the nation’s unbroken history of court rulings — including from the Supreme Court — that imbued the attorney general with the authority to appoint special counsels.

Notably, neither Trump nor his co-defendants have issued any legal challenge to the appointment of special counsel Robert Hur when Hur was investigating President Joe Biden. Exactly what will be in the report on Smith’s Jan. 6 charging decisions is uncertain, but much of it is expected to repeat allegations Smith laid out in his indictment against Trump. Trump and his lawyers have already reviewed both reports and in a court filing made Monday, Trump’s lawyers said that a draft version of the two-volume tome claimed the now-president-elect participated in an “unprecedented criminal effort” and that he was the leader of a vast number of criminal conspiracies. Trump has maintained his innocence in both the Jan. 6 case and classified documents case since he was first charged in 2023. During a press conference Tuesday he roiled over any release of Smith’s report, calling it and the underlying investigation “fake.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "DOJ Releases Special Counsel Jack Smith's Findings In Trump Jan. 6 Probe",
    "text": "The Justice Department delivered part of special counsel Jack Smith’s report to Congress early Tuesday morning, explaining his charging decisions related to the probe into now-President-elect Donald Trump’s alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election leading up to and during the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The report was originally intended to include information about Smith’s prosecution of Trump for his alleged illegal retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. But because the case is still active against two of Trump’s co-defendants, Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to keep those details under wraps for now. That case is likely to unravel entirely once Trump takes office, so it is highly unlikely that the public will ever see that information. Smith explicitly says he believes the department had enough evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction were Trump to stand trial. The 137-page document was first obtained by The New York Times. “The Department’s view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind,” the document reads. “Indeed, but for Mr. Trump’s election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.” Trump was indicted in August 2023 on four felony charges connected to Jan. 6: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. The latter charge was for allegations of intimidating voters as well as state and election officials. Trump spent months filing motions to dismiss the election subversion case, invoking everything from vindictive prosecution to total immunity, but was eventually scheduled to go to trial in March 2024. He eventually raised the question of whether presidents were entitled to immunity from prosecution to the Supreme Court, leaving the case in a lurch for weeks until justices ruled, 6-3, that presidents are immune from prosecution for “official” acts and entitled to “presumptive immunity” for unofficial acts. Smith revised and narrowed the original indictment to reflect the Supreme Court’s interpretation of immunity rules. His revised indictment would have forced Trump to defend certain conduct, including his speech from the Ellipse in Washington on Jan. 6 and his calls pressuring election officials to “find” votes for him, as “official” activity instead of campaign activity. But Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in November sealed the case’s fate: It was dismissed without prejudice, meaning it could be brought again at a later date. Since Justice Department guidance recommends that sitting presidents cannot be sentenced, however, Smith backed off. In the report, Smith defended the investigation from its inception, writing that Trump’s “unprecedented efforts to unlawfully retain power” after he lost the 2020 election “compelled” prosecutors to act. “Indeed, Mr. Trump’s cases represented ones ‘in which the offense [was] the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof most certain,’” Smith wrote, quoting a passage from the 1940 text “The Federal Prosecutor” by Robert Jackson, once the chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials for Nazis. Without regard for politics, “or the possible personal or professional consequences of a prosecution for me or any member of his office,” Smith said, investigators had “one north star.” It was “to follow the facts and law wherever they led,” the now-former special counsel wrote. “Nothing more and nothing less.” Smith, once the leader of the Justice Department’s public integrity division, said his office stands “fully” behind the decision to charge Trump because “to have done otherwise on the facts developed during our work would have been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor and a public servant. After nearly 30 years of public service, that is a choice I could not abide.” The report is divided into several sections, with much of it reiterating allegations Smith laid out in the revised indictment last August, but the final report also contains explanations for why prosecutors opted against charging Trump with other crimes, including crimes under the Insurrection Act. In U.S. history, there is little legal precedent available to help prosecutors interpret that law. To charge Trump, they would need to first define that what unfolded at the Capitol was unequivocally an insurrection against the authority of the U.S. and its laws. Then, they would need to prove that Trump incited the insurrection, assisted it or provided comfort to insurrectionists. While courts have found that Jan. 6 was an insurrection and even described it as such, Smith said, prosecutors understood there was a keen “litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long dormant statute.” Insurrections are defined generally as an uprising against a civil or political authority or established government. Other definitions, including legal definitions, acknowledge that it can also be a “rout, riot or offense connected with mob violence,” the report notes. Courts have also observed that insurrections typically involve overthrowing a sitting government, rather than maintaining power. Observing this, prosecutors said, they saw “another challenge to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Trump’s conduct on January 6 qualified as an insurrection given that he was sitting president at that time.” As they pored over litigation involving insurrectionary acts in years past to draw the comparison to Trump, Smith said, prosecutors could not find a single case in which a criminal defendant was charged with insurrection for “acting within the government to maintain power, as opposed to overthrowing it or thwarting it from the outside.” If Smith would have charged Trump with violating the Insurrection Act, it “would have been a first, which further weighed against charging it, given the available charges, even if there were reasonable arguments that might apply.” No matter how “strong the proof that he incited or gave aid and comfort to those who attacked the Capitol,” Smith wrote, the path to charging him under the statute was too “fraught with uncertainty.” A reasonable case could have been made by applying “incitement” standards, too, especially given the evidence that Trump knew the violence at the Capitol was foreseeable and “that he caused it,” Smith wrote. Trump understood the riot would benefit his plan to thwart the certification of the 2020 election, the report said, and he could use any disruption to leverage his position. “But the Office did not develop direct evidence — such as an explicit admission or communication with co-conspirators— of Mr. Trump’s subjective intent to cause the full scope of the violence that occurred on Jan. 6,” Smith wrote. The charges that were eventually applied were the best fit because they did not introduce untested legal theories and could be defended concretely before a jury. The report also goes into detail about some of the hurdles prosecutors faced once the indictment was made. Trump’s “ability and willingness to use his influence and following on social media to target witnesses, courts and department employees” forced the special counsel’s office to “engage in time-consuming litigation to protect witnesses from threats and harassment,” Smith wrote. That “intimidation and harassment” was nothing new, however. In fact, Smith wrote, it only emphasized some of what prosecutors had alleged: Trump regularly fell back on intimidation tactics that posed “real world consequences” in his bid to control the narrative. Recall, Smith wrote in his final report, just 24 hours after Trump was arraigned in the Jan. 6 case, he lashed out on social media, writing: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!” The very next day, one of his supporters, Texas resident Abigail Jo Shry, called the chambers of the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan — a Black woman — and called her a racial slur before vowing that if Trump didn’t win the presidency in 2024, “we are coming to kill you.” “So tread lightly, bitch. You will be targeted personally, publicly, your family, all of it,” Shry said in a voicemail. Shry pleaded guilty to making a threat over interstate communications and will be sentenced in March. Similarly, Tiffani Gish, another Texas resident, was sentenced to just over three years in prison for threatening U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, the jurist overseeing Trump’s classified documents case. Trump’s commentary prompted a narrow gag order in the case, and with Trump’s ensuing appeals, proceedings were slowed down significantly. Regular battles over Trump’s invocation of executive privilege over witness testimony and records added to delays. While investigators interviewed nearly 300 people and compiled a terabyte of records, Smith’s report notes, Trump’s repeated assertion of executive privilege caused major delays to the special counsel’s office receiving important records and evidence, including “testimony from senior White House staff and Executive Branch officials about topics such as Mr. Trump’s knowledge that he had lost the election and the pressure campaign Mr. Trump waged against the Vice President [Mike Pence] to convince him to reject legitimate elector slates at the Jan. 6 certification proceeding.” In his failed to bid to stop the publication of the report, Trump argued the findings were nothing more than a “political hit job” meant to upset the transition of power. On Tuesday morning, Trump took to his perch on his social media platform, Truth Social, and dubbed Smith a “lamebrain prosecutor” who was “unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide.” Over 140 police officers were injured and several people died in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot. At least 123 people have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon. Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, frequently calling them “hostages” and “patriots.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

In an interview with USA Today after the election, Joan Donovan, the founder of the nonprofit group the Critical Internet Studies Institute, warned indiscriminate pardons signaled “something very dangerous, not just for America but also for what could eventually turn into a civil war.” “I think that if Trump does pardon some of the more serious vigilantes from Jan. 6, that sends a clear message — that he is building a private army,” Donovan said.

    "text": "Donald Trump’s 2024 election campaign team welcomed the president-elect’s second Inauguration Day with a tasteless attempt at trolling outgoing President Joe Biden. The Trump campaign’s @TrumpWarRoom account on X, formerly Twitter, shared a spoof video that showed the Biden White House as a care home for seniors and where, per the narrator, its “residents feel like presidents.” See the video here. Trump’s team captioned the parody: “EVICTION NOTE. At 12:00 p.m. ET, White House Senior Living will cease to exist and its resident will be transferred to a Delaware facility on a permanent basis.” Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president at midday on Monday. The returning president himself shared the same video on social media in January 2024 amid rising concerns about Biden’s age and reports of his cognitive decline.

Biden backed his vice president, Kamala Harris, as his replacement, and she lost to Trump in November. Biden in January 2021 became ― at the age of 78 ― the oldest person to become U.S. president. Trump on Monday will overtake Biden for that honor, as he will be a few months older than Biden was at his swearing-in.

    "title": "Donald Trump Ignores Federal Laws As He Moves To Reshape Washington",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Donald Trump unleashed a flurry of sweeping executive orders, proclamations and regulatory freezes during his first week in office aimed at reshaping the federal government and enacting his MAGA agenda. And one thing the president isn’t letting get in the way of his mission: federal laws passed by Congress. Over the weekend, Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general, whose job is to root out corruption in government agencies, without notifying Congress in advance as required by statute, a move critics denounced as a “chilling purge” that signals the president intends to replace them with his loyalists instead. Several of Trump’s directives ordered government agencies to “pause” or withhold funds appropriated by Congress — including key climate investments, money for infrastructure projects and nearly all U.S. assistance to foreign nations — challenging the constitutional role of Congress and its power of the purse. Moreover, Trump’s decision not to enforce a federal ban on the social media app TikTok and his administration eliminating a school safety board that was created in the wake of the Parkland shooting massacre added to the list of actions that appeared to flout acts of Congress. “I think that Trump has issued many executive orders that are clearly illegal,” Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the dean of UC Berkeley’s School of Law, told HuffPost. “Some of it is political, some of it is to test the bounds of the law. He really wants to push executive power further than it’s ever been before.” Republicans who complained about executive overreach under Joe Biden’s administration praised Trump’s early administrative moves, even though some now acknowledge the president is acting outside the bounds of federal law. Asked Sunday if Trump violated the statute by not giving notice before firing the inspectors general across nearly all government agencies, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said, “No, he didn’t,” before retracting. “No, well, technically, yeah. But he has the authority to do it,” Graham said during an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “So I’m not, you know, losing a whole lot of sleep that he wants to change the personnel out. I just want to make sure that he gets off to a good start. I think he has.” Inspectors general are tasked with providing independent audits, inspections and investigations of government agencies. After Trump fired five inspectors general at the end of his first presidential term, Congress passed a law that increased the removal protections for the post, including requiring a 30-day notification as to the specific reasons for their removal action. Mark Greenblatt, inspector general at the U.S. Department of the Interior, said he received a two-sentence email on Friday evening informing him that he was terminated from his position. “These removals should be setting off alarm bells for a number of different reasons, but the primary one, in my view, is the independence of these positions,” Greenblatt told CNN on Monday. “The whole construct of inspectors general, it’s based on us being independent, that we’re not beholden to a political party … and so that’s the question is, what will — what will President Trump do with these positions?” Trump’s executive orders pausing the disbursement of funds appropriated by Congress drew criticism from ethics watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers who warned that Trump is violating the Impoundment Control Act, which sets limits on how much a president can restrict money approved by Congress. In addition to pausing nearly all U.S. foreign aid, Trump’s orders stopped money flowing to some programs established by Biden’s climate and health care law and his bipartisan infrastructure law. “Congress may give the president discretion regarding how to implement the programs for which it appropriates money. But in general, the executive branch does not have discretion whether to implement such programs,” the government watchdog group CREW wrote in a letter to congressional leaders on Monday. “Put simply, it is illegal and contrary to our constitutional structure for the president to disobey appropriations acts duly enacted after Congress publicly considers and determines funding levels for the federal government.” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, also criticized Trump’s spending freezes. The senator noted that both Trump and Russ Vought, his nominee to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget, view the Impoundment Control Act as unconstitutional despite there being no court decision finding it so. “It doesn’t matter how presidents feel about the law — it matters what the law is,” Murray said. “If Trump goes ahead and holds up funding that has been signed into law, it won’t just be illegal — it will hurt families, halt projects to rebuild America’s roads and bridges, kill good-paying new jobs and so much more,” she added. Trump’s executive order telling the Department of Justice not to enforce a federal ban on TikTok gave the popular social media app and its millions of users a reprieve — but it’s one that Congress never intended. The law, which passed last April, allowed the president to delay the Jan. 19 ban on TikTok for 90 days if he certified that there had been significant progress made toward a sale of the app. That’s yet to happen, and Trump has denied a report that the White House is working on a deal with Oracle and a group of other outside investors to secure TikTok’s presence in the U.S. “Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it, and I’d make that decision probably over the next 30 days,” Trump said of TikTok’s future over the weekend. But lawmakers in both parties said they don’t mind giving TikTok added time if it means its ties to China’s government are severed. “My understanding of where we are now is it’s much the same thing where there’s a period of time to allow a deal to be consummated,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told HuffPost last week. “The objective is to force China to sell the damn thing. If that’s where we end up, I’m happy.” Trump’s administration also terminated an office last week whose purpose was to advise federal agencies on best practices to protect students. It was created under Trump’s first term after the Parkland school shooting massacre and codified into law by the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which extended background checks for firearm purchasers under the age of 21 and boosted mental health programs. The panel included “school safety experts, alongside the parents of children who died in school shootings, advocates for civil rights and disability rights, superintendents, and leaders of organizations that represent school and district administrators,” according to Education Week. The Department of Homeland Security, under which the advisory panel was housed, told the outlet it would “no longer tolerate any advisory committee which push agendas that attempt to undermine its national security mission.” “The bipartisan law, as you know, took assault weapons out of the hands of younger people and was the first major advance in gun safety since the Brady Law,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday, referring to the federal law that required background checks on gun purchases. “I was the author of the Brady Law as well … this entire board, which is working hard to stop more Parklands from happening, has been shut down.” Legal experts said that every president issues executive orders testing the limits of their authority, but whether they will stick is far from guaranteed. “The ultimate question is will Congress find that these exercises of authority require any oversight? My assumption so far is, likely no,” said Aram Gavoor, an associate dean for academic affairs at George Washington University Law School. “I think it’s a bit of a wait-and-see. The president does appear to be exercising his authorities to deliver on campaign promises. Of course, litigation is already forthcoming, but many of these big questions would only be conclusively answered before the Supreme Court.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump named Leo Terrell for a civil rights post on Thursday, bumping the number of Fox News figures poised to join his administration to 18, according to The Daily Beast. The eye-raising figure appears to reflect Trump’s alliance with the conservative network, which he watched with stunning regularity during his first time in the White House and afterward. Fox News said the contributor contract of Terrell, who has been chosen to serve as senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, has already been terminated, Politico reported. Trump’s nominations and appointments of past and recent Fox News personalities include his recent naming of Tammy Bruce for State Department spokesperson. The list also features former “Fox & Friends Weekend” co-host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense, former Fox Business host Sean Duffy for secretary of transportation, former Fox News contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat for surgeon general, and former Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary for Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Mediaite noted. Mike Huckabee, who hosted a Fox News show for several years, has been tapped as ambassador to Israel, and Tulsi Gabbard, a contributor who also filled in as a host on occasion, has been announced for director of national intelligence.

    "title": "‘People Are Exhausted’: Democrats Plot A More Toned-Down Opposition To Trump",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― When Donald Trump took the presidential oath of office in 2017, he was met by angry protests of more than 4 million people across the country, a sustained movement that dedicated itself to resisting his administration in the name of women’s rights and civil rights. When he’s sworn in for his second term on Monday, Trump will find no such mass demonstrations or vocal opposition on the streets of the nation’s capital or elsewhere. The huge Women’s March protest of 2017, which has now been rebranded as the People’s March, is still expected to draw thousands to downtown Washington on Saturday, but the number of protesters is unlikely to match the historic turnout eight years ago. The lack of a new Trump resistance movement is a reflection of the fatigue many on the left feel in the wake of his 2024 presidential election victory, as well as a new strategy from Democrats and activists that ditches knee-jerk hostility and outrage toward Trump for a more toned-down approach that aims to home in on the effects of his policies on working-class people. “People in 2017 were deeply uncertain about what a Trump presidency would mean and wanted to raise their voices to try to influence them,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) explained to HuffPost. “This time, Trump and his tight band of billionaires have made pretty clear what the fights will be, and that’s less about protests in the streets and more about the hard, inch-by-inch fighting over tax policy and environmental regulations and building permits.” Already Democrats are warning the public about Trump’s plans to cut social safety net programs in order to pay for another round of tax cuts, his proposed across-the-board tariffs that could severely hit pocketbooks, and the many conflicts of interest in his billionaire Cabinet and among wealthy allies like Tesla CEO Elon Musk. They see calling attention to bread-and-butter issues that directly affect voters as a more effective way to go about handling Trump’s second term rather than, say, screaming about his proposal to acquire Greenland or his latest outburst online. “It’s like, mid-December, and I’m getting ready to get on the elevator, and, oh, Donald Trump just said he wants to, you know, he might invade Greenland,” Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) recalled of learning about the president-elect’s idea last month to buy the Arctic territory from Denmark. “And I could feel myself like starting to spin again, like, OK, what do I need to respond to? What do I need to say about this?” “I think that outrage machine is something that he drives, hoping that we’re all going to get on it, and we’re just not going to get on that machine anymore,” she added. “We’re still actively fighting them when they are doing things that we think are going to hurt people, [but] we’re not going to get pulled into that machine anymore. We need to be focused on what they are doing that is going to hurt people.” The Minnesota Democrat said that “people are exhausted” by the daily Trump news cycle, but she predicted that they would tune back in once Trump begins executing his agenda. The president-elect is reportedly planning to issue about 100 executive orders on Day 1 of his presidency, including a flood of immigration policy changes, such as mass deportations. He’s also expected to soon pardon hundreds of people convicted of participating in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, including possibly violent Trump supporters who assaulted police officers that day. “I think when they start to do the things that we’re fearful that they’re going to do, you’re going to see us fighting,” Smith said. In a sign of the Democrats’ changed posture toward Trump, the Senate on Friday advanced a major immigration bill aiming to crack down on immigrants lacking permanent legal status who commit crimes, clearing the way for Trump to sign it into law as early as next week. Ten Senate Democrats supported the measure, helping to hand Trump what is expected to be his first legislative victory.

    "text": "President Donald Trump revoked Secret Service protection provided to his onetime national security adviser, John Bolton, within hours of taking office on Monday. “I am disappointed but not surprised that President Trump has decided to terminate the protection previously provided by the United States Secret Service,” Bolton wrote on X on Tuesday morning. “Notwithstanding my criticisms of President Biden’s national-security policies, he nonetheless made the decision to extend that protection to me in 2021.” I am disappointed but not surprised that President Trump has decided to terminate the protection previously provided by the United States Secret Service. Notwithstanding my criticisms of President Biden's national-security policies, he nonetheless made the decision to extend… Bolton has had a round-the-clock security detail for years amid threats on his life from Iran. The Department of Justice charged a member of the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in a plot to hire a hitman to kill Bolton in 2022. At the time, officials said the plan was retaliation for the killing of Qassem Suleimani, a top Iranian general, during Trump’s first term. “That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump’s own assassination,” Bolton wrote Tuesday. “The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.” A notorious hawk on Iran, Bolton served in Trump’s first administration, but the then-president fired him after saying the pair had “disagreed strongly” on many things. Trump confirmed his plans to withdraw Secret Service protection for some in comments to reporters on Tuesday. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Donald Trump Jr. Says The Quiet Part Out Loud During On-Air Pitch To Acquire Greenland",
    "text": "Donald Trump Jr. wasted no time promoting his father’s plans to acquire Greenland. After visiting the country on Tuesday, he said the quiet part out loud, noting that the Danish territory has priceless “rare minerals” in the ground. Trump Jr. argued during a Newsmax interview that Denmark has prevented the Arctic island “from utilizing the great natural resources that they have, whether that’s coal, whether that’s uranium, whether that’s other rare minerals, whether that’s gold or diamonds.” The son of President-elect Donald Trump, who refused Tuesday in a press conference to rule out military force to absorb Greenland, even claimed that U.S. control would benefit “both the people of Greenland as well as the people of the United States.” “I think there’s definitely a path for my father and his administration to do something there that benefits both,” Donald Trump Jr. said on Newsmax, adding: “Both from a trade and commerce standpoint, from a military and strategic location, it actually seems like a total no-brainer.” Greenland has been a territory of Denmark for centuries but gained its own parliament and rights to home rule in 1979. It’s also a bastion of invaluable minerals that wealthy industrialists reportedly believe could power hundreds of millions of electric vehicles. Elon Musk, who has become a close confidante of Donald Trump, owns Tesla — one of the largest electric vehicle companies in the world. The tech billionaire endorsed and promoted plans to acquire Greenland on his social media platform. Donald Trump previously said, “For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” and doubled down Tuesday. While he has floated the idea since 2019, the people of Greenland have been pondering their own independence — with Prime Minister Múte Egede hoping to remove the “shackles” of colonialism during a New Year’s address, per Politico. The country can only declare true independence after a successful referendum, according to an agreement with Denmark in 2009, but Egede reportedly hinted last week that such a referendum could be held as early as April, the same month of parliamentary elections.

    "title": "Inside The Trump White House's Intense Screening Of Job-Seekers",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Job-seekers hoping to join the new Trump administration are facing a series of intense loyalty tests, with White House screening teams fanning out to government agencies to check for “Make America Great Again” bona fides and carefully parsing applicants’ politics and social media posts. President Donald Trump has long said he believes the biggest mistake he made during his first term was hiring what he considered to be the wrong kinds of people. Now, aides are working aggressively to ensure the government is filled only with loyalists. Negative social media posts have been enough to derail applications. Those seeking jobs have been told they will have to prove their “enthusiasm” to enact Trump’s agenda and have been asked when their moment of “MAGA revelation” occurred. One federal employee said they briefly considered buying Trump’s crypto meme coin in case the president’s team asked about their voting record. The intense screening has led some federal workers to question whether Trump’s team cares more about loyalty than competence. There is concern that his team is ousting foreign policy and national security diplomats and others who could offer the administration expertise and institutional knowledge at a time of conflict worldwide. Trump officials have made no secret of their intention to fill the administration with hires sharing the president’s vision. They began checking potential staffers shortly after Trump launched his campaign and have continued since he won. An application form on the Trump transition website, for instance, asks candidates, “What part of President Trump’s campaign message is most appealing to you and why?” according to a link obtained by The Associated Press. It also asks how they had supported Trump in the 2024 election — with choices including volunteering, fundraising, door-knocking and making phone calls — and to submit a list of their social media handles. “We are interviewing every single one of these individuals. If you are working in the federal government in a political appointee position, that comes through the White House now,” White House personnel director Sergio Gor said Thursday on Fox News. Trump, he said, “has been very clear of who he doesn’t want to include in this administration. And so those are clear guidelines that we adhere to. And we bring the best people possible into the White House and into every department across this land.” Screening teams deploy across federal agencies Some officials have referred to the newcomers sent by the White House to federal agencies disparagingly as “MAGA commissars,” a reference to Communist Party officials from the former Soviet Union. They are generally young and many do not appear to have particular expertise or background in the portfolios of the agencies in which they are working, according to three U.S. officials, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. They said the screeners seem to be looking for even the slightest divergence between candidates and Trump’s MAGA movement and “America First” policies. A negative social media post or a photograph with a Trump opponent has been enough for some applications to be rejected or put on hold for further review. One official said he and several colleagues from various agencies had been told that even if they passed the initial vetting process to be admitted into the applicant pool, they would still need to prove their bona fides and convince interviewers of their “enthusiasm” to put in place Trump’s policies, including by providing references from people whose loyalty had already been established. This official said one colleague who made it to the interview stage was asked when that person’s moment of “MAGA revelation” had occurred. At the State Department, which has been a particular Trump target since his first term, current officials have described the atmosphere as “tense” and “glum,” with career civil and foreign service officers leery of voicing opinions on policy or personnel matters, let alone politics, fearing retribution from their new political bosses. Two longtime department officials noted that there is always a period of uncertainty with any change of administration but that the current transition to a group intent on making sweeping changes to the management and work of the department was unlike what they have experienced in the past. Checking for MAGA alignment Trump administration officials had made clear plans for a robust screening process that would ensure all officials inside the administration — and especially those who could help shape policy — were aligned with Trump’s agenda, according to U.S. government officials and people familiar with their planning. One longtime government employee said he ran into a senior Trump administration official in December who told him that Trump’s team would look to be more thoughtful about how they were vetting appointees and even detailees. Those are nonpolitical, career experts on topics that range from counterterrorism to global climate policy who are loaned to the White House from other agencies for extended assignments. All appointees, the person said, would be issued questionnaires to ensure they were fully committed to Trump’s agenda. The AP has reported that career civil servants who work on the White House National Security Council have been questioned by senior Trump administration officials about which candidate they voted for in the election, their political contributions and whether they have made social media posts that could be considered incriminating by Trump’s team. On Wednesday, roughly 160 NSC detailees who worked in the Biden administration were told that they were being sent home so Trump’s team could conduct a review to ensure its personnel aligned with Trump’s agenda. “Every president is entitled to have a staff and the advisers that they need to implement the goals that the American people elected him to pursue,” Brian McCormack, chief of staff to national security adviser Mike Waltz, said in a two-minute phone call, according to a recording obtained by the AP. One NSC director learned that every detailee would need to be screened and that they would be queried about whom they voted for, political contributions and social media postings, according to a person familiar with the matter. White House officials defend their approach “No one should be surprised that those being hired should align with the mission of the Administration. Nobody in private industry would ever hire someone who isn’t mission focused, and the government should be no different,” White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said. “Over 1,300 individuals have been hired, while maintaining the highest standards of competency,” he added. Every new president looks to fill the thousands of government jobs they control with political appointees — rewarding campaign aides, allies, supporters and donors with plum positions. The White House presidential personnel office exists to recruit, screen and manage those employees. Asking applicants their political affiliations is common. In some cases it is required, such as when filling jobs on agencies or commissions that require partisan balance. Trump’s White House is going deeper into potential appointees’ political histories in part because he has carved out an ideological space that is often distinct from traditional Republican orthodoxy, making straight partisanship an unreliable indicator of commitment to his agenda. “The Trump administration’s conduct and imposition of a political litmus or loyalty test, it betrays the oath that the president took on Monday to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution,” said Donald K. Sherman, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group. “What this suggests to me is that demonstrating loyalty is as important or more important than merit.” Gor, in his Fox interview, said that in addition to hiring, the White House personnel office is also working to root out workers disloyal to Trump. “We’re also cleaning house. And so we started the process of terminating a lot of positions,” he said. “It’s time for a fresh start.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Trump shared two maps showing Canada incorporated into the U.S. The first image had the two countries combined, under the American flag. “Oh Canada!” Trump captioned the picture. Another map, that Trump shared online just five minutes after the first, showed Canada and the U.S. united — and covered by the text “United States.” While the posts were hailed by prominent “Make America Great Again” movement figures including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), critics slammed them as “unhinged” and one said they exposed Trump as “an imbecile who possesses the maturity of a petulant six-year-old child.” He was also dubbed “President Troll.” Trump has been talking up the idea of Canada becoming America’s 51st state and repeatedly mocked its now-outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with the title “governor.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "The Trump White House Wants A Court Challenge Over Frozen Funds",
    "text": "The Trump administration’s federal government funding freeze instituted Monday and apparently rescinded Wednesday appears to be a part of the White House’s official policy to get courts to hand President Donald Trump the power to pick and choose which congressionally authorized funding he will spend, according to a confidential document obtained by HuffPost. The confidential Office of Management and Budget document outlining “regulatory misalignment” calls on Trump to issue executive orders blocking the release of appropriated funds in order to provoke a court challenge over the president’s power to impound such funds. “Use executive orders to impound funds exceeding legislative intent or conflicting with constitutional duties, citing national security, fiscal waste, or statutory ambiguities,” the document states. “Seek legal precedent to affirm the President’s Article II powers under the Take Care Clause and Executive Vesting Clause.” That is what is playing out with the now-rescinded OMB memo freezing federal grants, loans and financial assistance across the federal government. Less than 12 hours after the OMB memo’s release, it was challenged in court by Democratic state attorneys general and a coalition of nonprofit groups. The challenge brought by the nonprofit groups resulted in a judge issuing a temporary restraining order blocking the freeze from going into effect Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, the administration rescinded the memo but then claimed that the policy was still in effect and officials only rescinded the memo to get courts to drop the restraining order. A second judge issued another temporary restraining order on Wednesday after the administration rescinded the original memo. This confusing series of events and conflicting statements and actions may be a fiasco, but the confidential OMB document makes clear that the administration intends on fomenting this very court challenge over the president’s power to not spend congressionally authorized funds. Trump is targeting the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a law that greatly restricts the ability of the president to defer or deny spending funds authorized by Congress. The law was passed after President Richard Nixon refused to spend funds appropriated for pollution cleanup and mental health centers, among other things. The Government Accountability Office determined that Trump violated it in 2019 when he withheld funds from Ukraine as part of a blackmail scheme targeting his 2020 election opponent Joe Biden. Russell Vought, Trump’s OMB director in his first term and current nominee to run it again, has been vocal about his belief the law is unconstitutional and that the president has inherent constitutional authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress as he desires. The Senate has not yet confirmed Vought to the position. Similarly, billionaire Elon Musk, who leads the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, has also pushed for challenging the Impoundment Control Act and stated in an op-ed written with his former DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy that “we believe the current Supreme Court would likely side with him on this question.” In response to a question about the confidential document, OMB provided a statement from press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,” Leavitt said in the statement. “The Executive Orders issued by the President on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the President’s orders on controlling federal spending. In the coming weeks and months, more executive action will continue to end the egregious waste of federal funding.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Reporter Asks Trump Why He Pardoned Cop-Beating Capitol Rioter. Wait For The Answer.",
    "text": "President Donald Trump dodged then rambled Tuesday when asked why he pardoned a violent Capitol rioter. (Watch the video below.) Trump granted clemency on Inauguration Day for about 1,500 convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. But his inclusion of those who attacked police reportedly went beyond what his own party wanted. NBC News’ Peter Alexander brought up one particular case to the returning president. “You would agree that it’s never acceptable to assault a police officer?” Alexander began. “Sure,” Trump said. “So, then, if I can, among those you pardoned, D.J. Rodriguez, he drove a stun gun into the neck of a D.C. police officer who was abducted by the mob that day,” Alexander said. “He later confessed on video to the FBI and pleaded guilty for his crimes. Why does he deserve a pardon?” “Well, I don’t know,” Trump answered. “Was it a pardon? Because we’re looking at commutes, and we’re looking at pardons.” Informed it was a pardon, Trump danced further. “We’ll look at everything,” he continued. (However, a pardon is not rescindable.) Trump diverted to false claims about murderers never being charged in blue cities. He veered off into false allegations about the George Floyd protests. But in the word salad were a few details about his decision to pardon, though not focusing on Rodriguez in particular. He asserted that those convicted had done enough time in conditions he deemed “inhumane.” “These people have already served years in prison, and they’ve served them viciously,” he said. “It’s a disgusting prison. It’s been horrible, it’s inhumane, it’s been a terrible, terrible thing. ... So, these people have always served a long period of time and I made a decision to give a pardon.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "How Trump's Political And Business Interests Will Intersect On His White House Return",
    "text": "As he assumes the presidency for a second time, Donald Trump brings with him a broad expanse of business relationships and financial entanglements — and the possibility that those associations could influence his decision-making in the White House. Trump’s team dismisses such concerns. “President Trump removed himself from his multibillion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary, becoming the first President to actually lose net worth while serving in the White House,” Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn’t get into politics for profit — he’s fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.” But questions remain. Here’s a look at the various connections and potential conflicts in Trump’s second administration. Winning Team Publishing Launched in 2021, Winning Team Publishing is run by Donald Trump Jr. and Sergio Gor, a Trump adviser selected by the president-elect to run the White House personnel office. Gor also led the pro-Trump super PAC Right for America. Trump has earned at least $11.6 million in royalties over the last two years from two of his books produced by Winning Team, according to financial disclosure statements filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. “Letters to Trump” is an anthology of correspondence from celebrities and politicians written to him over the years. “Our Journey Together” features hundreds of photos from his first presidential term with captions “handpicked” by Trump. Another coffee table book, “Save America,” features reminiscences from Trump’s presidential campaigns and term in office, as well as a lengthy reflection about his brush with death during a July assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania. Campaign finance records show Trump’s political fundraising committees have paid Winning Team Publishing more than $242,000 for unspecified books and printing services. The company also publishes titles written by Trump’s staunchest supporters, including GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk. Licensing deals Trump’s name and image are branded on a dizzying array of merchandise that he promotes and profits from through licensing agreements, including Bibles, diamond-encrusted watches, gold-colored sneakers and guitars that cost as much as $10,000. Thousands of copies of the “God Bless the USA” Bible Trump sells were printed in China, a country he has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices. As president, Trump would be able to exempt Bibles and other religious texts from hefty tariffs he’s threatened to impose on imported Chinese products. Trump’s endorsement of a line of guitars led to a “cease and desist” letter from Nashville-based Gibson Guitars. A company representative said in a brief statement the design of the Trump guitars infringes upon Gibson’s exclusive trademarks, particularly the body shape of the company’s iconic Les Paul model. Civil judgments Judgments of more than half a billion dollars from civil lawsuits hang over Trump and will be more difficult to avoid than the criminal cases brought by the federal government and then abandoned after his election in November. A New York judge ordered Trump and his companies earlier this year to pay more than $450 million after ruling he had manipulated his net worth in financial statements to secure favorable loans. That penalty came shortly after Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll for damaging her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault. A separate jury awarded Carroll $5 million from Trump for sexual abuse and defamation. Trump has appealed the rulings in the fraud case and one of the Carroll cases. His latest financial disclosure list more than $101 million in liabilities stemming from the two cases. As president, Trump can’t pardon himself for penalties imposed in civil cases unrelated to his official government duties, said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. And because the trials have already occurred, he’ll have difficulty arguing the cases are an undue burden on his time. Golf courses The constellation of high-end golf resorts Trump owns or manages generated hundreds of millions of dollars for him in 2024 and may pull in even greater sums once he’s back in the Oval Office. Trump’s financial disclosure reported close to $267 million in “golf-related” income, with another $161 million in combined “golf and hotel” proceeds from his Doral golf club in Miami. During his first term, Trump frequently promoted his golf courses and routinely played at them with a large, taxpayer-funded entourage in tow, leading to criticism that he was using the power of the presidency to enrich himself. Trump pushed to host the international Group of Seven summit at the Doral property in 2019. But he dropped the plan amid accusations he would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution that bans presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments. The golf courses may also attract foreign officials and special interest groups hoping to gain access and curry favor by spending large sums at Trump properties. Mar-a-Lago fees and Secret Service costs Since the start of Trump’s first term in office, the cost to join his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has soared to $1 million, allowing wealthy people to mix pleasure with politics and government business during his frequent visits to the club. While Trump collects income from Mar-a-Lago — $111 million over the last two years — he’s been accused of charging the U.S. Secret Service “exorbitant” room rates of more than $800 per night for agents assigned to protect him when he traveled there and to other Trump family properties. Who Trump meets with while at Mar-a-Lago and what he discusses are largely hidden from public view. The Secret Service has no electronic systems to screen or monitor presidential visitors to the estate, according to a 2020 federal appeals court ruling. Truth Social Trump launched his social media platform, Truth Social, in early 2022, after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. While he’s since been reinstated to both, Trump has often used Truth Social for more personal commentary, leaving traffic on X and other platforms for more formal statements and pronouncements. The company hasn’t disclosed how many users it has, so it’s hard to know how broad Trump’s reach there is. But what is clear is that Trump is the primary player in Trump Media & Technology Group, which started trading on the NASDAQ stock market in March. The incoming president has a majority stake in the company, and said shortly after his general election win that he had “NO INTENTION OF SELLING” his shares, which have significantly boosted Trump’s net worth, and at that time were valued at around $3.5 billion. Cryptocurrency Trump has promised to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” as he returns to the White House, a promise that would likely pay off for him personally. Amidst the 2024 campaign, Trump launched a new venture to trade cryptocurrencies that he has promoted on the same social media accounts he used for his campaign. His two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also posted about their new platform, called World Liberty Financial, as has his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is married to Eric and also serves as co-chair of the Republican National Committee. The new moneymaking venture could explode in value if Trump pushes through legislative and regulatory changes long sought by crypto advocates.

Several of Trump’s cabinet nominees, including Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick and Trump’s pick for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul Atkins, have substantial cryptocurrency investments.

    "title": "Why Trump's 'America First' Strategy Could Literally Make America Sick",
    "text": "This article is part of HuffPost’s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe. Pulling out of international climate treaties. Disrupting long-standing alliances. Ripping up trade agreements. Donald Trump has spent his political career promising to do all of these things and, now that he’s back in the White House, he’s already on his way towards accomplishing them. In just the first few days since taking office, he has ordered the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accords, announced his intention to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and continued to make noises about taking back the Panama Canal. There’s plenty more to come. As Trump sees it, the U.S. is in constant competition with ― and facing constant threats from ― other countries. It’s a nearly Hobbesian worldview in which there’s rarely common good to be found, or mutual benefit to cooperation. It’s what he means when he vows, as he did in Monday’s Inaugural address, that “during every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.” Trump is by no means the first American politician to talk or to think this way. But he’s the first to make this posture the official policy of the U.S. government — at least since the end of World War II, when U.S. leaders led the effort to create the agreements and relationships that Trump is trying to tear down. They did so in part because, after a worldwide economic depression and two horrific world wars, they had come to believe that more cooperation among countries would ultimately make the U.S. richer and safer. Seven decades of progress, prosperity and (relative) peace suggest they were largely right. That doesn’t mean global connectedness have always worked out to the benefit of Americans, or the rest of the world for that matter. That is why, for example, even defenders of international organizations like the United Nations have called for major reforms ― or why even many promoters of freer trade support initiatives that would protect U.S. workers from low-wage competition. But Trump has in mind a much more radical shift. And maybe no single Trump decision better illustrates his intentions than his order pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization ― a move that, public health experts told me this week, is fraught with danger. They don’t simply worry that withdrawing from WHO could undermine a vital international agency. They also fear that it will endanger Americans, making the nation more vulnerable to deadly diseases and new pandemics. And they make a compelling case. WHO is a United Nations sub-agency charged with promoting better health around the world. It dates to 1948, although its conceptual origins go back to the 19th century, when increases in global shipping created concerns about the spread of disease from dockworkers and locals to mariners, who would then take illnesses with them to other ports. “Preventing and controlling outbreaks is not just about the health of communities but also about economics and national security,” Preeti Malani, an infectious disease professor at the University of Michigan, told me. The concern led to a series of agreements including the 1892 International Sanitary Convention and 1926 International Maritime Sanitary Convention. These agreements set early, rudimentary standards for how to report outbreaks and when to impose quarantines. The establishment of WHO accelerated and strengthened these efforts — by, among other things, creating systems for global sharing of disease data, launching worldwide vaccination campaigns and coordinating responses to outbreaks. WHO played an essential role in the eradication of smallpox, by most accounts, and in the near-eradication of polio. That kind of work is still going on today, as is the response to sudden health threats. Just a few months ago, WHO coordinated what now looks like a successful effort to contain and then wipe out an outbreak of Marburg virus in Rwanda. It’s an awful disease that leads to bleeding, severe vomiting, neurological issues and eventually a painful death. But in the end there were just 66 reported illnesses and 15 fatalities, and within three months the lack of new cases allowed local officials to declare the outbreak over. “We found out about it quickly, and that was the way the warning system is supposed to work, and precautions were taken,” says Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy for the nonpartisan research organization KFF. “These are not things that the average American is going to always feel, but that’s partially because the system is designed to try to contain outbreaks when they happen.” Back in 2014, WHO wasn’t as successful at stopping an outbreak of Ebola, a closely related virus, that started in the western part of Africa before spreading to Europe and the U.S. Both at the time and later, experts faulted WHO for not raising alarms about the appearance of the disease earlier. But it was still WHO that coordinated the subsequent international response, whose success at preventing the virus from killing many more people won widespread acclaim. “WHO emergency teams were on the ground, they were isolating cases, they were providing health care,” Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told me. “They did the contact tracing and eventually stopped the pandemic in its tracks.” “Infectious pathogens don't stop at borders.” Of course, it’s WHO’s role in COVID-19 that has generated most of the controversy recently ― and, relatedly, has drawn Trump’s ire. From the earliest weeks of the pandemic, back in 2020, a variety of researchers and officials have blamed WHO for not putting more pressure on China to disclose information about the disease’s origins and initial spread. Trump, famously looking for people and institutions to blame, picked up on these criticisms and actually initiated the withdrawal process, which under U.S. law takes one year. President Joe Biden reversed that order upon taking office, but now Trump has reinstated it, citing “the organization’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China” as a reason. Trump has also complained that WHO membership costs so much money. The U.S. is the organization’s single biggest funder, with its roughly $1.3 billion in contributions over the 2022-23 period accounting for about 16% of the total WHO budget. During a Monday evening press conference, as he signed executive orders, Trump said “WHO ripped us off.” Among those orders was the one restarting the yearlong withdrawal process, which means the U.S. is now on track to leave the organization in January 2026. Even defenders of WHO say it has serious flaws, starting with the kind of excessive deference to strong member nations that WHO showed to China over COVID-19. Other problems include the bureaucratic inefficiency endemic to large international organizations, as well as a financial burden on the U.S. that even some committed globalists think other economically advanced countries could do more to share. “I think it’s really important to recognize that the challenges that the Trump administration is trying to address are real,” Judd Walson, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me. And while an effort to address some of those issues has been underway, in the form of a new worldwide pandemic treaty the Biden administration was negotiating, it has already drawn objections from many on the political right. According to these critics, the emerging treaty is either too weak (because it would still allow a country like China to get away with withholding information) or too strong (because it would require the U.S. to comply with new demands for information) or both. But Trump isn’t looking to alter the terms of that treaty, or propose some other way of improving WHO. He’s talking about withdrawing altogether. And while his executive order calls on his national security staff to find other ways of addressing global health, few public health experts think that’s realistic. “The U.S. has probably more technical expertise than any other nation in the world on health, it has the largest economy, and so in many ways it really can operate on its own more than any other country,” said Kates. “However, it can’t do everything on its own.” Gostin was even more forceful: “President Trump is living in Fantasyland. You can’t replace the singular global health organization that’s been the center of global health for more than 75 years. And if he thinks we can ― that we are stronger by going it alone ― he’s badly mistaken. It’s very clear our domestic capabilities can’t replace a worldwide network of surveillance and response.” A simple, practical way U.S. withdrawal could hamper future outbreak responses is by making communication more difficult. One of WHO’s most important functions is creating standards and expectations for the precise kinds of data member nations should provide, and then creating mechanisms for sharing it in real time. In theory, Walson said, nations could still provide and share information on their own. In reality, he said, it’s not going to happen seamlessly or quickly if the channels for communication don’t exist already: “There are technical challenges, like who exactly in these other countries is going to provide the data … who do they approach in the U.S. about it.” “The thing that makes us weaker is just to take all our marbles and go home.” But probably the biggest single worry among these experts is that without U.S. leadership and money, the organization would simply not be able to do as much. It’s even possible U.S. withdrawal would set off a chain reaction in which other powerful countries start pulling back as well ― until, eventually, WHO is a shell of its former itself, with nothing similar replacing it. “If that happens ... then the whole goal of having global cooperation at times of crisis in particular really gets affected,” said Kates. “You can see that playing out ― now there’s no global cooperation, we’re all in it for ourselves. And then that’s like a dystopian movie.” As an example of what that dystopia might look like, Walson imagined another outbreak of Ebola or Marburg in a small West African country without the resources to identify, track or contain the virus on its own. The first reports of fever would come in, but they’d struggle to figure out whether it was just another normally circulating disease like malaria or something worse ― and, once they understood the threat, it would take them time to mount a response. It could be devastating for the country and, as past outbreaks have shown, potentially devastating for the rest of the world too. “People are moving, leaving their country to go work in a neighboring country,” Walson said. “They’re going into airports where they’re in contact with business travelers, who then fly into a European country and meet their American counterpart at a meeting in Davos or in London.” “Infections spread quickly, so our inability to know that there’s a potential threat, to assess the threat and to help respond and contain that threat, will have immediate and direct consequences for our security,” Walson said. One way WHO could weather a U.S. withdrawal would be to lean more on other powerful nations, although doing so would likely empower China ― the very nation Trump sees as America’s chief adversary ― and leave the U.S. with even less influence over global health policies. “The thing that makes us weaker is just to take all our marbles and go home, because whenever there is a vital public health decision around the world to be made, the U.S. will be on the outside looking in,” Gostin said. And while the longstanding U.S. support for WHO may seem to critics like a naïve attempt at creating a utopian global community, Walson says, it’s actually a recognition that the world is full of suspicious and hostile powers ― and that, when it comes to health, mutual survival depends on getting past that. “We are viewed as a major and important actor in the global health space ― and that trust and belief that we do it not only for ourselves, but that we do it for the community as a whole, has consequences,” Walson said. “There is a level of willingness to engage that allows us to work with countries that otherwise we would not be able to work with effectively, because of that level of trust.” This is obviously not the perspective of Trump, whose views on the world as a competition for dominance sounds a lot like some of the prevailing sentiments of the 19th century. As Walson noted, those worries about maritime trade spreading disease came from the colonial powers because they were the ones dispatching the ships. Leaders of those nations embraced international cooperation over health largely out of self-interest: They didn’t want to bring illness back home. Later the same impulse helped lead to the creation of other international organizations and agreements, covering everything from trade to security.

    "title": "Billionaire Oil Ally Doug Burgum Confirmed As Trump’s Interior Chief",
    "text": "The Senate voted Thursday to confirm former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as President Donald Trump’s secretary of the Interior Department. At the helm of the massive federal agency, Burgum will be responsible for managing 500 million acres of federal land ― roughly one-fifth of the United States — including 63 national parks, as well as conserving imperiled species and honoring the government’s trust responsibilities for more than 500 federally recognized tribes. Twenty-five Democrats joined all 53 Republicans in voting to confirm Burgum as the nation’s 55th secretary of the Interior Department. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) and John Fetterman (D-Pa.) abstained from voting. The billionaire software entrepreneur and two-term governor pledged during his Senate confirmation hearing to aggressively advance President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda via increased drilling on federal lands and to prioritize industry innovation over regulation. And he argued Trump’s energy vision has the ability to end foreign wars and drive down inflation, while protecting clean air and water. “The American people have clearly placed their confidence in President Trump to achieve energy dominance,” Burgum said. “That’s the foundation of American prosperity, affordability for American families and unrivaled national security.” Burgum’s nomination proved far less controversial than many of Trump’s other Cabinet appointees. During his confirmation hearing, Burgum escaped questions about his personal financial ties to oil tycoon and GOP megadonor Harold Hamm or his state’s support of a Utah lawsuit aimed at wresting control of millions of acres of public land from the federal government. Burgum, who has voiced skepticism about the reliability of wind and other renewable energy, will step into the agency on the heels of Trump signing a suite of executive orders on energy and the environment, including directives to boost fossil fuel production and halt wind energy development. He would play an outsize role in carrying out those orders. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said in a floor speech Thursday that Burgum’s confirmation would help bring an end to “the age of climate alarmism.” “The golden age of American energy dominance is here,” he said. Responding to Burgum’s confirmation, Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said it is “alarming that so many Senate Democrats were duped into voting for an oligarch who is now charged with stewarding the nation’s public lands and wildlife.” “Burgum’s just the latest in a parade of unqualified political cronies to swear fealty to Trump and his plans to wreck our climate, eradicate endangered species and destroy our public lands,” he said in a statement. During Trump’s first term, the Interior Department was plagued by ethics scandals. Trump’s first interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, resigned after two years on the job amid a flurry of federal investigations. At least four of those probes documented misconduct, including that he misused his office and lied to investigators. Late last week, Trump fired at least 12 independent inspectors general, which act as internal agency watchdogs. Among those let go was Interior Inspector General Mark Greenblatt, a Trump nominee who released several scathing reports on ethical misdeeds during Trump’s first term.

Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. In the dead of winter, the soles of your feet have likely seen better days. Whether they’re cracked, crusty or just callused, your piggies are probably due for some TLC. While you could fit frequent spa trips into your budget, you could also grab this highly rated IBNG electric foot file, for just $31 (if you remember to clip the on-page 5% off coupon before adding it to your cart). That’s less than a single pedicure at most places, for a device you’ll get to own for many winters to come. Loved by construction workers, runners and folks who have fruitlessly tried all sorts of things in the name of soft feet, this little machine helps you buff away rough, dry spots and cracks. “My cracked heels have always bothered me with embarrassment and pain.. sometimes even making walking and standing painful,” reviewer Chrsity Johnson wrote. “With this I can say goodbye to that forever...so if you suffer from cracked heels don’t hesitate get it now!” Some say this option helped them break up with the nail salon, saving them from $60+ pedicures. While others who still enjoy professional treatments, say this tool helps their feet stay soft and smooth between spa trips. Run via an outlet cord, you never need to worry about charging or recharging the handy little machine. The adjustable speed lets you choose the tempo that feels right for your feet, helping you file all the nastiness away without causing pain or irritation. Its handle is designed to be easily held in your hand and to glide around your foot. As reviewer Susie Babusi says, the tool is, “Easy to use on the toes as well. Speed is easy to adjust. Overall, this sander is easy to control and easy to use.” Reviewers also say it’s easy to clean and a breeze to swap out the sandpaper filling pad, of which the brand gives you 60. And when you do eventually run out, a re-up of 60 sandpaper pads is less than $10! The IBNG brand recommends that you soak your feet in warm water for about 20 minutes before using the tool. Then, apply a new filing disk and be careful not to use too much pressure so the head can actually spin. After filing, treat your feet to a little oil or cream to keep them moisturized. (We recommend this well-reviewed $15 sore muscle massaging oil or the $6 Gold Bond softening foot cream.) We’ve got a long way to go before the weather turns. If your winter feet are feeling more like hooves, it may be time to treat yourself to this budget-friendly at-home callus remover. “I have tried everything known to man for my heels and NOTHING has every worked like this does. Everything else is going in the garbage. The disks have a nice grit on them and they last - I did both heels that weren’t in great shape and the disk still has life in it. They send you 60 - you can replenish. You can control the speed so start slow and work up. It’s powerful so pay attention to how its doing before you automatically turn up the speed. Might be my favorite item yet this year!” — J. Carman “Brought one as a gift for my hubby who works in construction. He loves it for both his hands and feet. So I decided to buy one as a earlier bday gift for myself. Best to use it after you shower then rinse, your feet will feel like baby soft skin. OMG once you cream or oil your feet it feels like butter!!! One of the best selflove gifts so far for 2025” — Gia “This little thing is bleeping awesome! I rarely say that. I was fully prepared for it to not be powerful and the moment it touched my skin to have the power dragged down. It absolutely does not. The discs last a long time and there are 80 replacement discs! This has a plug-in so you don’t have to worry about the power running out. You can vary the speed. It comes with a little brush to brush off dead skin cells from the sanding disc and your foot as you go along. This is absolutely worth the money.” — Jenifer “This is the best. My feet were not bad, but they just needed a little maintenance. This product is the best. I have used it once, and my feet are so soft. It has been a month, and they remain the same. After a few more uses, I can imagine how my feet will look and feel. It is so easy to use. I love that I can adjust the speed, and it is plug-in or battery-operated.” — Amazon customer “I literally had the crustiest feet from working on concrete and wearing the same steel-toed shoes for a year. This piece of equipment works wonders. Highly recommend!” — Amazon customer “This was so much better than the grater I had been using. I have a healed, past broken foot that develops a callous on the bottom. This little machine worked like a dream to flawlessly remove that with little effort. I love this and would highly recommend it!” — Amazon customer By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "This Back-Saving Electric Spin Scrubber Is The Perfect Helper — And It's Under $30 Today.",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Cleaning your floors, bathtub and even high-up surfaces can be an ordeal, especially if you experience pain, limited mobility or are just really low on energy some days. Instead of straining your back, arms or neck to get hard-to-reach grime and dust, consider upgrading your cleaning process with this top-selling electric spin scrubber — on sale now for under $30, with a $10 coupon for a limited time. The chargeable cordless device comes with a retractable pole that lets you reach the ground without hunching over and spin away dirt with a swiveling scrub head by way of an easy trigger pull. Tidy reviewers flooded the reviews section, noting that the scrubber is a significant quality-of-life upgrade and a handy back-saving tool. One reviewer sums it up nicely, noting that it helps them “work smarter, not harder.” The back-saving spin scrubber is a 7-in-1 tool with six different brush types plus a scouring pad for reaching any corner, nook or cranny with ease and cleaning wider surfaces. What makes it so much easier on the body is its lightweight and retractable rod that reaches 43- and 55-inch lengths so you can reach the ground without bending. Plus, it breaks down into a smaller, 9.8-inch handheld brush for smaller scrub tasks! Many reviewers say scrubbing is effortless and doesn’t require much arm, back, or leg strain to clean. “Having a [bad] back, I got this to help me clean the bathroom tub and floors,” wrote reviewer Stephanie Caskey. “It work better than I expected and I am very pleased with my purchase. Even my 10-year-old granddaughter can use it.” “It shortened a normally 30-minute job down to 15 minutes,” another reviewer, Amy Faatz, shared. The cordless gadget has two adjustable speeds and a battery offering a 90-minute run time before needing some extra juice, which is ample time to clean your bathroom or living room floors. It’s also useful for cleaning grout, stone, tile and hard surfaces that collect buildup over time or even vents and car rims. Reviewer Rick Hickman found it useful for more than just a shower scrub: “I originally got this product for my bathroom, however, after seeing how well it worked, I started using it on my baseboards and it worked like magic,” he wrote. “No more bending over and hurting my back to clean!” “I recently bought an electric spin scrubber, and it has been a game changer for my cleaning routine. The rotating brushes make quick work of tough grime, and the ergonomic handle is comfortable and easy to maneuver. The battery lasts about 60-90 minutes, which is sufficient for my needs. I appreciate the various brush heads that cater to different surfaces. Overall, it’s powerful, user-friendly, and a great investment for anyone looking to simplify their cleaning tasks! Highly recommend!” — Sergio  “We have an older shower/tub with lots of tile and sliding, etched glass doors. I hated scrubbing all of the soap scum off. It’s a very enclosed space, so lots of crouching and awkward angles to clean off everything. I decided to splurge on a spin brush, and I chose this one specifically because of all of the different attachments and extendable handle. It’s been saving me a ton of time, plus the long handle makes it much easier to scrub the floor and lower basin without killing my back from crouching. I’ve only used this in the shower/tub so far. I can see this working great in your kitchen too. It’s well worth it to buy this!” — Raya  “I have used this spin brush to clean all sorts of places that are difficult to clean otherwise. I have used it for baseboards, window sills, ceilings, walls, and my shower. The battery life is pretty good for how small it is. It is light weight and easily adjustable for longer reach. The power on the spin is great, if you apply pressure while it is spinning, it does not slow the speed down at all like some other spin brushes. Added perk; if you’re scared of spiders like me - this has even come in handy to smoosh some spiders from a distance so I didnt have to get close to them lol. All in all I love this spin brush and highly recommend it.” — Summer L.  “I absolutely love this tool. A little Bar Keeper’s Friend and the brush attachment cleaned the soap scum right off of my tub and sink. I can even clean in the corners with the pointed brush. The battery lasts a long time and the extension handle makes cleaning up high a breeze. There are so many attachments and they are easy to remove and replace. Highly recommend.” — R.

    "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Debuts Surprising Post-TV Look In Rare Public Outing",
    "text": "Ellen DeGeneres has a brand new look for the new year. Months after packing her bags and moving to rural England with her wife, Portia de Rossi, the former talk show host, 66, was spotted rocking a new hairstyle — a gray pixie cut — during an outing in Montecito, California, on Tuesday. DeGeneres, who is known for her blond, layered cut, paired her newly minted hairstyle with a casual gray sweater, blue jeans and white sneakers, as seen in photos published by People. Sources told multiple outlets late last year that the longtime couple put their Montecito estate on the market after President-elect Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Late last year, DeGeneres confirmed her and de Rossi’s move in an Instagram post celebrating their 20th anniversary, following reports that the pair’s home in the Cotswolds region flooded during Storm Bert. “P.S. for those of you concerned, our UK farmhouse did NOT flood,” she wrote in a Dec. 1 2024 post. DeGeneres has rarely been spotted since her mainstay talk show “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which ran for 19 seasons, came to an end in May 2022. In DeGeneres’ 2024 Netflix special “Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval,” the star jokingly claimed she was ”kicked out of show business” for being “mean,” telling the audience “this is the last time you’re going to see me. After my Netflix special, I’m done.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Elon Musk Doubles Down On Salute Controversy With A Bunch Of Nazi Jokes",
    "text": "Elon Musk, billionaire adviser to President Donald Trump, leaned into the accusations that his Monday salute was a “Sieg heil” gesture with a series of trollish Nazi puns on X. “Don’t say Hess to Nazi accusations!” Musk wrote Thursday, referring to German Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess. “Some people will Goebbels anything down!” he joked, referencing Joseph Goebbels, the deeply antisemitic Nazi propaganda minister who organized the 1938 Kristallnacht assault on Jewish families. Other lines invoked Hermann Göring, the Nazi military leader who wanted to rid Germany of its Jewish population, and Heinrich Himmler, the SS chief who was instrumental in planning the Holocaust. “Bet you did nazi that coming,” Musk added at the end, with a laughter emoji. The Tesla CEO has been making light of the outrage over his salute, which came at Trump’s inauguration rally before the president stopped by Washington’s Capital One Arena. Musk agreed with another X poster who shared a video of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), claiming the two men were making the same gesture, although Walz used an open palm and a slack arm, unlike Musk. Don’t say Hess to Nazi accusations!Some people will Goebbels anything down!Stop Gőring your enemies!His pronouns would’ve been He/Himmler!Bet you did nazi that coming 😂 The world’s richest man followed his Nazi puns with a post reading, “When I see the troll emoji, it’s like looking in the mirror.” His supporters have argued alternately that Musk’s autism affects how he behaves in public, and that the salute was nothing much out of the ordinary. Musk made the gesture twice while he thanked Trump’s supporters in the arena, saying at the time, “My heart goes out to you.” The Anti-Defamation League covered for Musk on Monday, saying in a statement that he should be given “a bit of grace” or “perhaps even the benefit of the doubt,” although critics rejected the group’s response. Conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also rose to Musk’s defense on Thursday. But the ADL and its CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, did not extend their tolerance to Musk’s comedy. “The Holocaust is not a joke,” Greenblatt wrote on X, tagging Musk. The ADL denounced him for “making inappropriate and highly offensive jokes that trivialize the Holocaust.” Making inappropriate and highly offensive jokes that trivialize the Holocaust only serve to minimize the evil and inhumanity of Nazi crimes, denigrate the suffering of both victims and survivors and insult the memory of the six million Jews murdered in the Shoah. https://t.co/pYpTeRu3Aa Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Millions Of European Heat Deaths Projected As World Warms",
    "text": "Extreme temperatures — mostly heat — are projected to kill as many as 2.3 million people in Europe by the end of the century unless countries get better at reducing carbon pollution and adapting to hotter conditions, a new study says. Currently, cold temperatures kill more people in Europe than heat by large margins. But a team from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used climate simulations of different scenarios and looked at death rates in 854 cities. They found as it warms cold deaths lessen slowly, but heat deaths soar rapidly. With few reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases and little adaptation like air conditioning and cooling centers, Italy, southern Spain and Greece should see massive increases in the rate of heat deaths due to climate change. On the flip side, much of Scandinavia and the United Kingdom will see fewer temperature-related deaths, mostly due to moderating cold temperatures, the study in Monday’s journal Nature Medicine found. But even in the most optimistic scenarios — with carbon dioxide emissions from coal, oil and gas cut sharply and massive increases in adaptation — there’s a net increase in temperature-related deaths as the world warms, said study lead author Pierre Masselot, an environmental epidemiologist and statistician. The drop in cold deaths up north are in places not as populated as places further south, where the heat really kicks in and hurts, Masselot said. “The Mediterranean is a so-called climate hotspot,” Masselot said. “It’s a region that is warming much quicker than the rest of the world. And Malta is right in the middle of it.” The study projects Malta’s temperature-related death rate to increase by 269 people for every 100,000 by the end of the century. By contrast, Ireland’s will go down slightly, 15 per 100,000 people. In general, western Europe being wealthier fares better than eastern Europe, Masselot said. Several heat waves have killed thousands of people in the last few years in Europe, but one in 2003 is the biggest with about 70,000 deaths. Big cities with lots of people near the Mediterranean can see the bodies pile up through the rest of the century. The study says in the worst case they studied Barcelona could see nearly a quarter million extra temperature-related deaths, while Rome and Naples get close to 150,000 deaths. In a scenario with carbon pollution only slightly worse than current trends and no extra adaptation to heat, Masselot’s team found more than 5.8 million excess heat deaths just from climate change, but nearly 3.5 million fewer cold deaths too. The team has a interactive website where cities and different factors can be adjusted. Masselot’s team was also able to isolate out climate change, removing a major factor of an aging population which made the study even more useful and impressive, said University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi, who wasn’t part of the study. “This very much lines up with what we would expect,” said Dr. Courtney Howard, a Canadian emergency room physician and vice chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance. She was not part of the study. “When you think about summertime daytime temperatures in places like Rome — they start to get up into the 40s (104 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit).... That’s very heat stress/heat stroke territory for healthy young people and very dangerous for older people, particularly if they don’t have air conditioning.” Europe having older housing stock and not much air conditioning needs massive amount of adaptation, such as central air, more green space and cooling centers, to lower the projected death rates, Masselot said. North America is less likely to have such a strong trend, he said. Another factor is the aging of Europe makes its population more vulnerable, Masselot said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "title": "Family Vlogger Accused Of Briefly Kidnapping Woman In Texas Before Flying Off To Qatar",
    "text": "A family vlogger and online rapper whose YouTube channel amassed over 1 million subscribers is accused of briefly kidnapping a woman in Texas before then relocating outside the U.S. Corey Pritchett Jr., 26, was charged on Dec. 26 with one count of aggravated kidnapping. He is accused of taking the woman on a high-speed car ride with a second woman and threatening both of their lives, according to a criminal complaint obtained by HuffPost. Pritchett on Friday addressed the allegations in a message to his over 600,000 followers on Instagram, writing, “Don’t worry lol I’m finna give the Details on here & in the Court of Law.” The incident underpinning the charge allegedly took place Nov. 23 in the Houston area, with the two women telling police that they planned to ride ATVs with Pritchett and go bowling that night, according to the complaint. But after they arrived at the bowling alley, the women thought the rapper seemed to be acting suspicious, and they asked him to leave, which he did. One of the women later messaged Pritchett to say they had left some items in his car, according to the complaint. Pritchett met with the women at a parking lot and offered to give them a ride home, to which they agreed. During the drive, both women noticed Pritchett’s behavior was different from earlier in the day. Eventually Pritchett drove in the opposite direction of one woman’s apartment and ended up on the highway, the complaint said. Pritchett was allegedly making phone calls to unknown people as he seemingly increased the vehicle’s speed to over 100 mph. The women said Pritchett pulled out a gold-colored handgun and waved it out of the vehicle’s sunroof. One woman told Pritchett to take her back to her apartment. She attempted to calm him down by asking him to pray with them as he continued to drive at a high speed, according to the complaint. At one point, Pritchett made a video call to an unknown person whose contact was saved in his phone as “Future Wife.” He asked her “if he had the perfect opportunity and was driving in the middle of nowhere and no one could hear them scream,” authorities wrote in the complaint. The person on the phone responded with a yes. The women feared for their lives, believing they were going to be taken to a remote location to be killed, according to the complaint. Pritchett took the women’s phones after noticing that they had been texting each other, the complaint said. Pritchett allegedly fired four to five shots out the window and pointed the firearm at the women around this time. He then pulled over on the shoulder of the highway and ordered the women to get out the vehicle, the complaint said. “This is your only opportunity,” they claimed Pritchett told them. When he drove off, the two women flagged down a good Samaritan and called 911, prompting law enforcement to respond, according to the complaint. The woman stated that Pritchett had at one point told them “I’m gonna fuck yall and then kill yall.” One of the women had screenshots from a location-sharing app that police said corroborated their statements, including claims about the high speed of Pritchett’s vehicle. Authorities were unable to make contact with Pritchett, but said he indicated on social media that he was leaving the U.S. to “start a new life in Dubai.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Jayden Daniels And The Commanders Stun The Top-Seeded Lions 45-31 To Reach NFC Title Game",
    "text": "DETROIT (AP) — Jayden Daniels and the nothing-to-lose Washington Commanders sent the top-seeded Detroit Lions to a stunningly swift playoff exit. Daniels threw for two touchdowns and fellow rookie Mike Sainristil had two interceptions, dazzling performances that helped Washington beat Detroit 45-31 on Saturday night to reach the NFC championship game for the first time since winning the franchise’s third Super Bowl 33 years ago. “It’s a surreal moment,” Daniels said. The sixth-seeded Commanders (14-5) were nearly double-digit underdogs against the Super Bowl-favorite Lions (15-3) and overcame doubts as they did all season with a new quarterback, coach and general manager. “I always believed that we could achieve more than people give us credit for,” Daniels said. Detroit, the NFC’s top team for the first time with a franchise-record 15 wins, doomed its chances of living up to expectations by turning the ball over five times. “This isn’t the time to talk about what a great year we had and all the wins,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. “We’re here to get to the show and we fell short. That hurts.” Sainristil, who won a national title at Michigan last season, picked off his second pass on a trick play with receiver Jameson Williams throwing into coverage off a reverse in the fourth quarter. “Mike is somebody that he’s hard to fool,” Commanders coach Dan Quinn said. Quan Martin returned a pick 40 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter to put Washington ahead 24-14. Jared Goff threw three picks and lost a fumble, turning it over three times in the ill-fated first half. He finished 23 of 40 for 313 yards with a touchdown pass to Sam LaPorta that gave the Lions their last lead midway through the second quarter. Daniels finished with 299 yards passing and 51 yards rushing, and — just as important — didn’t turn the ball over. “He has a different poise,” Quinn said. “He’s a rare competitor.” Daniels became the second rookie quarterback to knock off a top-seeded team, joining Joe Flacco, who led Baltimore past Tennessee on Jan. 10, 2009. “Nothing surprises me with him,” said receiver Terry McLaurin, who turned a short pass from Daniels into a 58-yard touchdown. Quinn led Washington to its first playoff win in 19 years last week. The Commanders rallied past Tampa Bay for their sixth comeback win and fifth straight on the final play from scrimmage in regulation or overtime. The Commanders, who converted 3 of 4 fourth downs, didn’t let Detroit keep it that close. “Give them credit,” Campbell said. “They earned that game and we didn’t.” Washington outscored Detroit 28-14 in the second quarter — the highest-scoring quarter in NFL playoff history — to take a 31-21 lead at halftime. Daniels had 242 yards passing in the first half, setting a rookie record one week after becoming the first rookie to lead his team in yards rushing and passing in a playoff win. The former LSU star, who was the No. 2 pick overall, was 22 of 31, including the long TD on the screen to McLaurin and a 5-yard throw for a score to Zach Ertz in the second quarter. Brian Robinson ran for 77 yards and two touchdowns. Detroit’s Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 105 yards and two touchdowns while Amon-Ra St. Brown had eight receptions for 137 yards. Goff fumbled in a collapsing pocket on third-and-1 from the Commanders 17 late in the first quarter and Washington took advantage. Daniels converted a fourth-and-3 from the Detroit 9 to extend a drive capped by Robinson’s 2-yard touchdown run. Three snaps after Daniels’ TD throw to McLaurin, Goff overthrew his intended target and Martin intercepted it and took it to the end zone, putting the Commanders ahead 24-14. Goff took a hit from linebacker Frankie Luvu on the interception return and was evaluated for a concussion. Detroit’s defense could not stop the Commanders all night, and Washington set a season high in points. The Lions started the second half strong, forcing Washington to punt for the first time and going 76 yards on 11 plays on the ensuing drive, capped by Gibbs’ 8-yard run for his second touchdown to make it 31-28. Detroit, though, wasn’t stingy for long on defense. Washington had a 15-play, 70-yard touchdown drive — extended by Detroit having 12 men on the field when facing fourth-and-2 from its 5 — and Robinson’s second short touchdown run restored the Commanders’ 10-point lead. Commanders: OG Sam Cosmi was injured on Robinson’s go-ahead touchdown early in the second quarter. His right leg bent awkwardly and he limped off the field. Lions: CB Amik Robertson suffered a broken arm on Washington’s second snap. ... OG Kevin Zeitler (hamstring) and reserve DL Pat O’Connor (calf) were inactive. Washington will play the winner of Sunday’s Los Angeles Rams-Philadelphia Eagles game next Sunday on the road for a spot in the Super Bowl. ___ Follow Larry Lage at https://apnews.com/author/larry-lage ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Former Child Star Rory Sykes Dies In LA Fires After Mom Was Unable To Save Him",
    "text": "Former child star, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Rory Callum Sykes, is among those who died in the devastating Los Angeles wildfires this week, according to his mother. Shelley Sykes, mourned her 32-year-old son in a post on X on Thursday where she shared, “It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of my beautiful son @Rorysykes to the Malibu fires yesterday. I’m totally heartbroken.” She went on to call the British-born, Australian national a “wonderful son” and “true humanitarian.” Born blind and living with cerebral palsy, Sykes appeared on the British and Australian TV shows “Kiddy Kapers” and “Mornings with Kerri-Anne” as a child and later worked as a professional inspirational speaker. His life story became the subject of his mother’s book, “Callum’s Cure,” which was published by Simon & Schuster in Australia in 2010. According to Rory Sykes’ website, he was also a consultant for organizations like the Tony Robbins Foundation and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, as well as the co-founder of the Happy Charity alongside his mother. “He overcame so much with surgeries & therapies to regain his sight & to be able to learn to walk,” Shelley Sykes wrote on X. “Despite the pain, he still enthused about traveling the world with me from Africa to Antarctica.” “He will be incredibly missed.” It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of my beautiful son @Rorysykes to the Malibu fires yesterday. I’m totally heart broken. British born Australian living in America, a wonderful son, a gift born on mine & his grandmas birthday 29 July 92, Rory Callum… pic.twitter.com/X77xyk83gx In an interview with Australian outlet 10 News First, Sykes’ mother said that fire officials told her her son died from carbon monoxide poisoning after he was stuck inside the cottage he lived in at his family’s 17-acre Malibu estate. Recalling the harrowing scene, Shelley Sykes told the outlet she was unable to get her son out of the structure on her own after downed phone lines made it impossible for her to reach 911. “I couldn’t lift him, I couldn’t move him,” she said. When Shelley Sykes then tried to control embers that had fallen on the cottage, she “couldn’t put out the cinders on his roof with a hose because the water was switched off by” the local Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, according to her post on X. “Even the 50 brave fire fighters had no water all day!” she added. This week, The Associated Press reported fire hydrants near the Pacific Palisades blaze had run dry after high demand left the community’s million gallon tanks without enough water to pressurize the system. Since Tuesday, emergency services across Los Angeles County have been working to contain multiple wildfires spurred on by high winds and dry conditions in the region. In addition to the Pacific Palisades fire that killed Rory Sykes, firefighters have been contending with the nearby Kenneth fire, as well as the Eaton fire which has consumed thousands of acres around the city of Altadena. A smaller but still substantial blaze named the Hurst fire continues to roar near the base of the Angeles National Forest.

    "title": "Fox News' Jessica Tarlov Hits Sean Hannity With Blunt Reality Check On Biden",
    "text": "Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov recently took on network host Sean Hannity after he pressed her to weigh in on President Joe Biden’s lone White House term, which is set to come to an end with President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration next week. On Friday’s broadcast of the show “Hannity,” Tarlov pointed to gas prices dropping, the nation’s 4.1% unemployment rate, growth in gross domestic product and a decrease in crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, before calling on Hannity not to “deny the reality” of outcomes that the Biden White House “oversaw in the end.” “There’s a reason that Donald Trump wants to try to take credit for these things,” she said. “And there’s also a reason that now, Donald Trump, like in his Time interview ... admitted, oh, well, prices are really hard to get down.” She then pointed to Vice President-elect JD Vance’s recent call to “stabilize” prices and Tom Homan, Trump’s pick to be border czar in his new administration, reportedly telling Republicans to adjust their expectations around upcoming deportation efforts. “They’re backing off of the promises that they made to the American people because they know they’re not going to be able to achieve them,” she said. Hannity predicted that history will “not be kind” to Biden, whose most recent and final approval rating matched the lowest of his presidency. Tarlov gave Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris a grade of “B” when asked how they performed in their four years in the White House. She went on to say that there’s been “a lot” done for the country under Biden and Harris through the so-called PACT Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, as well as the bipartisan infrastructure bill.

    "title": "Fox News Interviews People In Greenland, And The Results Are Awkward For Trump",
    "text": "A Fox News correspondent went to Greenland and said “most” people she spoke to were critical of Donald Trump’s push to take control of the Danish territory. Reporting from Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, Alex Hogan said on Tuesday there had been a “lot of mixed reaction” there about the president-elect’s pitch. She started by sharing snippets of an interview with an “avid Trump supporter,” Jørgen Boassen. He was kitted out in Trump merch and said Greenland is the “front door” to the U.S., suggesting the island could need protection from Russia and China. It seemed as though Fox News could not find many others who shared his views. “Most other Greenlanders we spoke with quickly bashed Trump’s comments, calling them offensive,” Hogan reported. The conservative network showed clips of several interviewees saying they would prefer to remain with Denmark. Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark with its own parliament. Fox goes to Greenland and learns they’re just not that into us: “Most of the people we spoke with did not support Trump’s comments and found them offensive.” pic.twitter.com/rktcaZjZ7q In recent weeks, Trump has revived his call for the U.S. to purchase the territory despite pushback from Danish and Greenlandic officials. In a rambling press conference last week, he declined to rule out using military force to take control of Greenland, saying, “We need Greenland for national security purposes.” His son, Donald Trump Jr., visited Greenland last week and claimed the people there were fed up with Danish control. He also claimed that locals “love America and Trump” and posed for photos with people wearing MAGA hats, which according to local media, were handed out by his team. A member of Greenland’s parliament said much of the visit was “staged to make it seem like we — the Greenlandic people — were MAGA and love to be a part of the USA.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "American tennis player Frances Tiafoe didn’t let a bout of on-court vomiting prevent him from winning his opening four-hour match against France’s Arthur Rinderknech at the Australian Open on Monday. Tiafoe, ranked 16th in the world, won the first two sets and lost the third. He then threw up during the fourth set, which he went on to lose. But the Maryland-born athlete received medical attention and recovered enough to go on and win the fifth and final set, 6-3. Watch the video here. At the post-match news conference, the 26-year-old admitted he may have quit the game had it not been at the prestigious tournament. The sickness wasn’t explicitly down to the heat, he added, noting he was probably “overly hydrated mixing a lot of electrolytes” and that it was mainly electrolytes and water that had come up, not food. But “it is what it is and I’m happy I got through,” he told reporters. Tiafoe said he felt physically “terrible” after the win but at the same time “great because you get to see another day” at the event. “I’m going to sleep tonight with a little chuckle on my face for sure,” he added. Of going viral, Tiafoe said it was “funny.” “I mean it’s it’s part of the game [and you have] got to be ready for all things and got to be willing to lay it all out there,” he added. Tiafoe will play Hungary’s Fabian Marozsan in the second round.

    "title": "Reviewers Say This Rugged GPS Watch Outperforms The Apple Watch",
    "text": "HuffPost receives a share from retailers on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. They say a broken watch is right two times a day, but a rugged Garmin outdoor watch with GPS capabilities? It promises to be right all the time. With its location features, suggested workouts, in-depth health tracking and a battery that can go up to 28 days between charges, this watch is becoming a favorite of trail hikers, construction workers, folks in the military and others who spend extensive time outdoors and/or exposed to extreme temperatures. In fact, a ton of reviewers claim they like this baby more than the Apple alternative. A rugged outdoor watch, Garmin’s Instinct model is ideal for nature lovers and fitness fanatics alike. With its long-lasting battery, you can keep it on as you sleep to track your body and health 24/7. And it uses GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite systems to help you find your locations even when you’re off the grid, and lets you set a mark for your camp, car, trailhead or other area of interest to help you find your way in the woods. The watch will receive notifications from your Apple or Android phone, allowing you to see calls, texts, emails and alerts, and has its own app store letting you set your own interface and download whatever apps you want (like Starbucks or Spotify) right to your wrist. It comes with the specific Garmin cable you need to charge it. And while it doesn’t have a touch screen, it does have control buttons on the watch itself and can connect with your smartphone or other Bluetooth devices. You can even bring it with you in all elements as it’s water-rated to 100 meters, is thermal-, shock- and scratch-resistant and has a fiber-reinforced polymer case to keep it protected when you’re hiking, camping, mountain biking, trail running or skiing. It also has an incident-detection feature that will send out alerts to your contacts automatically in the event of an emergency. And if you’re looking to spend extended time in the outdoors or just want even more battery life, you’ll want to grab the solar version, which extends its battery life via solar power. Gym rats will love the built-in workout features including pre-made workouts for HIIT or skiing, as well at fitness tracking that will show your metrics and remind you to take recovery time. The watch can also track your stress level, heart rate, energy, blood oxygen level and menstrual cycle. With a 4.7 overall rating on Amazon, the Garmin Instinct is a clear fan favorite for outdoor smart watches. Get one today and see where it takes you. “So far I’m impressed by how rugged this watch is. It is not a touch screen, and I’m still learning how to navigate all the features, but it does allow you to upload a gpx file of your desired trail and that makes navigation on the mountain a great deal easier.” — Travis “My husband loved this watch! He wanted an Apple Watch, but he does work in intense temperatures, and where he’s exposed to different elements. Being in the military, this watch is perfect since he barely has time to sleep somedays, much less charge his watch! He goes almost three weeks between charges, and never worked about cracking the screen. It still has the same functions he desired from the Apple Watch with added benefits.” — Jace “I needed a fitness watch that would keep track of not only steps but also walking and running sessions. It does all of this and more. I haven’t even scratched the surface of what it can do. The Connect mobile app does a good job of capturing all activity and presenting it in a orderly manner. It’s pretty intuitive and not overdone, very well laid out and easy to navigate. The price point was not too bad either. So far I’m happy with it.” — kbb “I bought this watch over a year ago. I work construction and am very very hard on wristwatches. This watch is worth every penny. It’s tough, durable, and the battery is amazing. In all reality you could go nearly a month between charges. I typically go 20+ days between charges. The face itself has no scratches, but after a year + of daily wear the bezel is showing some slight signs of wear and scratches, but none on the face itself. For the money, it’s perfect.” — Amazon customer “I work in extreme environments and climates. From freezing to burning. My apple watch always stressed me out because it would die continually and fail to operate when I needed it to. This is a great watch.” — Doug By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Gretchen Whitmer Says She Isn't Looking For A Fight ... Yet",
    "text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Few Democrats have gotten as much attention for fighting Donald Trump as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose battles with the former and future president during the COVID-19 pandemic first vaulted her onto the national stage. But with Trump’s inauguration just days away, Whitmer plans to send a public message that she’s willing to work with him ― at least if he’s willing to work with her, and depending on what he actually tries to do. The message will come on Wednesday morning, when Whitmer gives a speech focusing on economic policy at the annual Detroit Auto Show. It will include a clear warning that the tariffs Trump has proposed could hurt the auto industry more than they help, by disrupting supply lines across the Canadian border, raising the prices of raw materials and triggering a trade war that would diminish exports. But the speech will also include a recognition that Trump carried her state in the November election ― and that, in Whitmer’s view, the voters “expect us to find common ground” on solving everyday problems. “I don’t want to pretend we’ll always get along,” Whitmer will say, according to excerpts her staff shared with HuffPost, “but I will always seek collaboration first.” Exactly what those words will mean in practice is hard to say, especially given that the prepared text also includes a promise that Whitmer “won’t back down” from political battles. But the speech comes in the middle of a contentious debate among Democrats over whether to fight ― and, if so, how hard ― over everything from aggressive Republican immigration proposals to Trump’s most controversial Cabinet nominees. In a brief telephone interview on Tuesday, Whitmer acknowledged that broader debate taking place among Democrats and said her remarks place her “somewhere in the middle” of it. “I’ve had outreach from some of my colleagues who are fighting, taking up that mantra, and I said, ‘You know, listen, Michigan is very different, and my job is to deliver for the people of Michigan, and my ability to do that requires that I have the opportunity to work with the new administration,’” Whitmer said. “I care about getting stuff done, and finding common ground is a better way to do it than starting from a war footing.” Whitmer’s thoughts on these matters are of particular interest because she has won two convincing victories in her politically divided, electorally vital state. Lots of activists, funders and officials think she might make a strong presidential candidate if she decides to run in 2028 ― although Whitmer, to be clear, says she is focused strictly on how to govern now that Republicans are taking control of one house of the Michigan Legislature, as well as the White House and Congress. “I know that there are a lot of folks out there jockeying to be the leader of the opposition ― that’s not me,” Whitmer said, adding, “My first job is to see if I can find partners and find collaboration, and that’s what I’m out to do. The people of Michigan elected Donald Trump twice, they elected me twice, both within two years of each other. And here we are.” That Whitmer would stake out this position isn’t entirely surprising given her own political history. Republicans have controlled at least one of the state’s legislative chambers (and usually both) for most of her 20-plus years in state politics, and during that time she has frequently talked up the virtues of compromise. Her biggest achievement as a state senator was working with Michigan’s then-Republican governor to pass a bill that expanded the state’s Medicaid program. When she first became governor, she focused on reforming auto insurance and “fixing the damn roads,” in both cases by negotiating with Republicans who had majorities in both houses. But while the auto insurance package came together, the road funding deal didn’t. And then the pandemic hit. When both Trump and Michigan Republicans attacked her over public health orders, she fought back over the GOP politicizing the crisis and, in Trump’s case, providing insufficient help from Washington. Two years later, she took up another fight ― this time, for reproductive freedom. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Whitmer acted quickly to protect abortion rights in Michigan while campaigning for a ballot initiative to make those protections permanent ― reminding voters, all along, that without Trump’s appointments to the high court, Roe would still be law. In the interview, Whitmer suggested she was willing to put past acrimony aside if there are places where she and the new White House can work together. “I’ve been in this situation before,” she said, referring to collaborations with Republicans in her state. Among the issues on which that might come into play is the future of electric vehicle subsidies, which are a big deal to Michigan’s auto industry. Trump has promised to repeal what he’s been calling the “EV mandate,” claiming it’s pushing American manufacturers away from more profitable lines of business. Whitmer, during the 2024 presidential campaign, repeatedly blasted Trump for that position, arguing that taking away the support would undermine the boom in EV factory construction and employment ― and put American companies at a disadvantage globally while China and the rest of the world move toward electrification. When asked whether she saw the EV debate as a place to oppose Trump more strongly, she reiterated her belief that backing electric vehicle production is necessary to keep Detroit’s manufacturers competitive. But she also described the situation as “an opportunity for education.” “Education” seems to be the approach she’s taking on another issue of vital interest to automakers ― namely, Trump’s promise to impose steep tariffs on all imported goods. Whitmer, in her remarks, plans to say that she’s “not opposed to tariffs outright” while warning that such a broad change could backfire, especially the efforts to target Canada. “Think about this: 70% of all the auto parts we make in Michigan go directly to our neighbors,” Whitmer plans to say. “Every time a Michigan auto part crosses over the border and gets taxed, those costs will be passed on to you at the dealership. Sometimes it happens a couple times throughout production. That means you’ll pay more to buy a Silverado, fix the engine in your Mustang or replace the fender on your Jeep Grand Cherokee.” When it comes to immigration ― perhaps the issue most central to Trump’s presidential campaign ― Whitmer said didn’t want to “draw red lines” publicly about what kinds of Trump moves might prompt her to protest loudly or to refuse state cooperation, as some other local and state officials have already threatened. One reason, she said, is that she’s waiting to see how aggressively Trump acts once he actually assumes office. “We’ve done a lot of planning for a variety of scenarios,” Whitmer said. “We also know that candidates say things on the campaign trail and then sometimes it’s different from what they do once they take office. I’m not suggesting that it should be underappreciated how serious they are. I’m saying we don’t know what they’re going to do until they get there.” But Whitmer added that, in gaming out the possibilities of how she might respond to mass deportations and other actions, “I take very seriously the use of state resources and fundamental rights of human beings.” Whitmer also pledged to fight any further attacks on reproductive rights, citing the overwhelming approval for state protections by Michigan’s voters in 2022. And she said she intends to continue speaking out on behalf of the LGBTQ+ community, citing not only a recently enacted state law enshrining those rights but also her feelings as a parent. “As the mom of a gay woman, I can tell you that getting Michigan on the right side of the law was really one of the things I’m most proud of from the last two years, and this is something I take very seriously,” Whitmer said.

    "title": "7 Ways To Have More Energy In 2025",
    "text": "If our culture of coffee, energy drinks and espresso martinis tells us anything, it’s that we’re all pretty tired these days. And how could we not be? We live in a go, go, go society where everything and everyone is vying for our attention — our families, friends, work, the 24-hour news cycle and social media, just to name a few things. Modern society makes it easy, even normal, to feel depleted at all times, which makes it really hard to break the cycle of exhaustion. But that doesn’t have to be your reality. There are habits and behaviors that can help you feel less exhausted. Below, doctors share what they are and how you can incorporate them into your everyday life: You can’t expect to sit around all the time and have energy, said Dr. Chris Scuderi, a family medicine physician in Florida. If you want to feel more awake, you should prioritize movement of some sort, whether it’s walking, jogging, cycling, yoga, HIIT, Zumba or something else entirely. “Movement is really big, it’s just great for the body,” Scuderi said. “Exercise moderately at least five days a week. I always try to encourage my patients to do something every day. Try not to have a zero day, even if it’s a 10-minute walk after dinner or just doing some stretching or some calisthenics — that daily movement is just so good for our bodies.” Exercise is known to help you sleep better, too, which in turn will give you more energy. “When you are exercising on a daily basis, you have less sleep latency, so you fall asleep more quickly, and I think you get to deep sleep in a much more rapid fashion, which is the restorative benefit of sleep that a lot of people who don’t exercise don’t really get to,” said Dr. Patrick Doherty, an assistant clinical professor of neurosurgery at Yale Medicine in Connecticut. There’s a time and place for all food (no, I will never give up pizza), but certain foods are known to be a drag on your energy levels. The food we put into our bodies is what drives us, Doherty explained. This is why people fuel up with carbs the night before a marathon or eat a protein-packed meal after a weightlifting session. The idea is to prioritize the “right proportion of carbohydrates, proteins, fats [and] the right amount of fruits and vegetables,” as well as limiting “processed foods [and] avoiding foods with a high glycemic index, as much as possible,” Doherty said. “The food that we bring in is vital to [our] well-being, and certainly to our energy level.” This doesn’t mean you have to live off of nuts and berries, but you should aim for balance with a focus on food that makes you feel good, Doherty noted. “Food is fun and we need community, and sitting at the table with our friends and family is great for us,” Scuderi said, adding that you should also ask yourself: “Am I eating in a way that’s going to help me to feel energized, versus grabbing something quick, that’s ultraprocessed, that’s maybe going to make me feel good for 10 minutes, but then drain my energy an hour or two later?” “I think it’s vital to find something that satisfies you and that makes you literally physically and emotionally energized to get through the day,” Doherty said. “For me, it’s my career, my surgery, but it’s also time with family, and particularly travel. I like to experience new things.” Take time to consider what you enjoy. “If we’re doing things we love, it’s not work, it’s a call, and it does energize you versus if I’m doing something I’m miserable doing or I’m in a place where I’m not happy, it’s an energy drain,” Scuderi said. Think about it: If you’re excited about gardening a few days a week, you’ll have more momentum to move through the more monotonous moments. “I think we had this little spurt of energy after COVID, because the world shut down, we had this new lease on life — ‘oh my gosh, I’m going to travel, I’m going to do this, I’m going to exercise, I’m going to any number of things,’ and I think most of us have settled back into the normal daily grind that is not particularly energizing,” Doherty said. What energizes you will be different from what energizes your neighbor, partner or sister. Make sure you carve out time to do whatever it is that excites you each week. “[Stress is] a literal drain, physically and mentally,” Doherty said. And it plays a major role in your energy levels. If you’re stressed, you probably won’t be sleeping well, you may not have the energy to make nutritious meals and you might even skip your workouts. “We need to look at ways to make sure that we’re having that balance where the body has time to rest and recover,” Scuderi said. This could mean taking time to vacation, meditate, pray or spend time in nature, he added, or it could mean something else altogether. Seeking support from a mental health professional can be another good way to manage stress. Caffeine may give you that morning boost to start your day, but Doherty said you should be mindful of just how much coffee you’re drinking. “In moderation, [there’s] nothing particularly wrong with it, but I wouldn’t have more than a cup or two of coffee a day,” Doherty said. He added that you shouldn’t have caffeine in the latter part of the day. “I would probably stop any coffee ingestion towards the early part of the afternoon, because having coffee within probably six hours or so of trying to go to sleep is going to disrupt [sleep].” Another beverage that can get in the way of good sleep: alcohol. “In moderation, small amounts [of alcohol] once or twice a week is reasonable, but daily drinking is certainly not healthy, and drinking within an hour or two of bedtime disrupts the sleep cycle,” Doherty explained. Overextending yourself certainly isn’t going to do your energy level any favors. So being able to say “no” to requests that drain you is a crucial skill to learn, Scuderi said — “whether that’s saying no to technology, whether that’s saying no to toxic relationships, whether that’s saying no to demands of the people around us, or maybe our job that’s hurting us.” If you agree to see a friend who dumps their trauma on you over and over, you’ll only leave the gathering feeling depleted. Or if you agree to take on an extra project at work that keeps you working well into the evening, you’ll only be more tired. “There’s almost a badge of honor for being busy, and I fall into this as a physician, but we need to be our best selves, and that’s taking time to make sure we’re recharging our batteries, too,” Scuderi said. Even if you follow every single piece of advice mentioned above, if you don’t get enough sleep, you won’t feel more energized. It’s important that you go to bed at a reasonable hour, get seven to nine hours of sleep and wake up at a consistent time each day, Doherty said. But sleeping for seven to nine hours isn’t always good enough. You’ve probably heard of “junk sleep,” which is low-quality sleep that doesn’t actually leave you feeling refreshed. “Quality sleep is [something] that I think people don’t appreciate,” Scuderi said. Certain habits such as looking at screens right before bed, eating late and taking late naps can also keep you from getting the quality sleep you need. “You can read, you can just lie there and think and meditate and not rev up the brain at that point, but just sort of try to wind down,” Doherty said. A cool, dark and quiet room can also help facilitate high-quality rest. Doherty said that if you’re still not feeling rested, there might be something else wrong. “Maybe you’re not sleeping well for a reason, maybe you’re not exercising for a reason. Maybe you have a thyroid issue, maybe you have sleep apnea, maybe you have some kind of metabolic disorder.” He recommended having a medical professional assess your energy levels. But regardless of the cause, you shouldn’t have to go through life depleted and tired. Whether there is something medically going on or you’ve fallen victim to some energy-depleting habits, there are things you can do to feel more energized each day.

    "title": "Doctors Recommend Heated Masks For Dry Eye Relief. This One Is Nearly 50% Off For Prime Members.",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Many of us suffer from dry eyes, especially in the cooler months, but not everyone has to live with red-eyed irritation. We recently discovered that a heated eye mask can help moisten those eyeballs and prevent them from drying out during the day. Per Dr. Anat Galor, a Florida-based ophthalmologist and clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, previously told HuffPost, abnormalities of the Meibomian glands — the glands in eyelids that produce the oil component of tears — can contribute to dry eye symptoms. “One treatment that is used to improve Meibomian gland health is to apply heat to the glands to help the release of oil onto the surface of the eye,” says Galor. If you’re looking for dry eye relief (or the perfect Valentine’s Day gift), we found a cordless, heated eye massager mask on sale for 47% off its typical list price if you’re a Prime Member. It’s currently $59.99 for Prime members, but when you clip the $7 on-page coupon, that price drops down to only $52.99. Non-Prime users, meanwhile, can still grab it with that coupon for a discounted price of $62.99. Reviewers call it a “magical eye hugger” for relaxation, and many call it amazing for relieving tension headaches and dry eye care. And better yet: This self-care product is FSA/HSA-eligible, so if you’ve got some healthcare bucks to spend before the end of the month, this is a great way to do it. This soft eye mask can relieve eye fatigue, dryness and sinuses with a low heat temperature (104℉ to 114℉) and gently massages your eye sockets with air compression. Its auto-off feature turns it off after 20 minutes of use, so you can set it over your eyes at bedtime and swipe it off when it’s over. Reviewers say it charges quickly via USB, plus it’s super comfy to wear. To operate it, you just tap a few of its side buttons and you’re good to go. “This product has become a daily thing for me” explains one reviewer. “If you have tension headaches or dry eyes, use this for a couple [of] days and watch it cure you. I look forward to using this every night. I have discontinued my eye drops because I don’t need them anymore and have cut way down on headache meds!” Take a look at more promising reviews below and nab this rechargeable mask for dry-eye relief during the cold months. It’s a great solution for your tired, dry eyes. They also make an incredible holiday gift! “This product has become a daily thing for me! If you have tension headaches or dry eyes, use this for a couple days and watch it cure you! I look forward to using this every night! I have discontinued my eye drops because I don’t need them anymore and have cut way down on headache meds! It is incredibly durable and portable! I love that it folds in half to become more compact when not in use. I charge the battery every few uses so it has good battery life. The air compression makes noise but I just turn on the calming music to max and it drowns it all out! It is just too easy to use, put it on, turn it on and relax! By the end of the session I’m normally almost asleep! It does tell you when the session ends and that startles me sometimes because I’ve drifted off lol” — Jacquelyn Schack  “I bought this for my wife for Christmas, but after two migraines this week, decided to give it to her early. Her immediate response was ‘This may be the best gift I’ve ever gotten!’. She made me use it before bed last night, and I really was impressed at how relaxed I was after. The heat is just the right amount, and the compression feels incredible. I’ll be getting more of these.” — Justin Davis  “The RENPHO Eye Massager is the best impulse purchase I’ve ever made, and I’m saying this as someone who once bought a chia pet at 2 a.m. DAMN THE HSA—I would’ve bought this magical eye hugger even if it wasn’t eligible. Who needs a tax break when you have Bluetooth heat-induced bliss strapped to your face? Picture this: me, lying on the couch, Bluetooth serenading me with smooth jazz, and my eyes getting a spa treatment so good they might start charging me rent. It’s like tiny masseuses are gently punching my stress away, all while my to-do list silently judges me from across the room. Eye strain? Gone. Stress? Melted. Will I ever take it off? Doubtful. Buy it for Christmas, birthdays, or just because life is too short not to experience this level of relaxation. Forget the HSA rules—your eyes deserve this masterpiece of modern comfort.” — K.Good  “dont waste your money going for dry eye treatment at the eye doctor. Insurance doesnt cover dry eye. i spent $700 on a treatment and later that night my eyes were tearing again. I decided to try this because i was out of ideas, it immediatly was not only soothing but my dry eye is alot better ... amazingly better and its only been a week.Battery life is decent, heat level perfect, massage very relaxing. i never write reviews but had to on this product.” — Kathleen Brave  “Bought it for my husband who had eye problem. Been using it for other purpose too, ie relaxing, tired eyes, etc. the air pressure gently massage the eyes without being too hard. Comes with some options/combination of air pressure, vibration and heat. Very quiet. It works better than our old microwaveable beads eyes as this generate consistent heat from start to finish without getting burn. The price is a bit on the expensive side, but we are using it.

    "title": "Mike Johnson's Fate Uncertain As House Speaker Vote Looms",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― When it meets for the first session of a new Congress on Friday, the House of Representatives has to elect a speaker before it can do anything else. It’s not clear if Republicans are up to the task. Current House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) projected confidence on Thursday morning that he would be reelected, but allowed that the vote would be close. “We’ll have a margin of probably two votes tomorrow during that, so can only afford to lose one or two, but I think we’ll get it done,” Johnson said on “Fox & Friends.” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has said he won’t support Johnson, and several other Republicans, such as Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), have sharply criticized their speaker while not outright promising to vote against him. The stakes are high. Johnson noted that if the House doesn’t elect a speaker, then Congress won’t be able to certify President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election. “We cannot afford any palace drama here,” Johnson said. “We have to certify the election of President Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, on Monday.” Palace drama has been a persistent feature of Republican rule since winning the House in 2022. It took former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) 15 ballots to win the speaker’s gavel in January 2023. Eight months later, Republicans dumped McCarthy for allowing the House to pass a government funding bill with support from Democrats. For three weeks, the House ceased functioning while Republicans struggled to figure out who could succeed him, ultimately settling on Johnson because he had made the fewest enemies since coming to the House in 2017. Once again, the Republicans who oppose their speaker have no clear alternative. And a prolonged speaker drama could even interfere with the inauguration of the president-elect on Jan. 20. Last month, Trump spoke out against Johnson’s plan to fund the government, prompting several days of chaos before Johnson ultimately defied Trump’s demand that he include a provision adjusting the federal government’s borrowing limit in the bill. But Trump endorsed Johnson for speaker this week. Still, it’s not clear if Trump’s endorsement can sway House hardliners. “I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan,” Massie said on social media, referring to another former speaker who fell out with Trump and the rest of the party. “We’ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "What Really Happens If You Eat Eggs Past Their Sell-By Date?",
    "text": "One of the top food stories over the past few years has been the notorious rising cost of eggs (the current national average is $4.62) due to supply chain issues. And in late January, things have gotten even worse — many store shelves’ egg sections are empty, thanks to the bird flu epidemic. So with that in mind, you may wonder how to make the most of your eggs. Is it OK to eat them past their “sell-by” date instead of throwing them out? Or is that a bad idea? We spoke with health and food safety experts to find out how far we can push the limits — and what may happen when we do. In the United States, the outsides of eggs are washed with warm water to clean the shell — but that process also removes the exterior cuticle, which HuffPost has previously reported prevents bacteria and spoilage. (Europeans don’t wash their shells.) After undergoing that process, in the U.S. “eggs can last between three to five weeks post-purchase as long as they are refrigerated and stored in an environment with a temperature below 40 degrees Fahrenheit,” said Dr. Michael Chichak, medical director at MEDvidi. Pete & Gerry’s, a popular brand of organic and pasture-raised eggs, adheres to a similar timeline. “For our eggs, best buy date means that we recommend consuming them on or before the date printed on the carton,” said Cameron Whitehead, the brand’s chief operating officer. “Our eggs are typically processed within a few days of being laid and printed with a best-by date, which is 30-45 days from processing, depending on different state regulations.” According to Dr. Laura Purdy, a board-certified family medicine physician, sell-by dates can be confusing because the government doesn’t regulate food product date labels. “In fact, this is solely up to the manufacturers and companies to determine how they are going to create that date, which is usually picked based on quality,” she said. “This means when the food item is going to be the freshest and taste the best. It has nothing to do with the food being safe to consume.” “Eggs naturally have a small air pocket,” said Darin Detwiler, a food safety academic, adviser, advocate and author. “As they age, moisture and carbon dioxide escape through the porous shell, increasing the air pocket size. This makes the egg less fresh but not necessarily unsafe.” He further explained cracks in the shells can allow bacteria to enter, leading to contamination. Because of chemical degradation, the old eggs begin to smell bad. “Proteins and fats in the egg break down, creating foul-smelling sulfur compounds like hydrogen sulfide,” he said. “Spoiled eggs often have an off-putting odor, slimy texture or discoloration.” Trista Best, a registered dietitian at The Candida Diet, added: “Fresh eggs have a pH of around 7.6, which is slightly [alkaline],” she said. “As eggs age, the pH rises and results in a sulfur taste.” The rule is: If the eggs smell fine, it’s probably OK to eat them. “As long as the eggs are stored in the fridge, eggs shouldn’t spoil,” said Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist for Consumer Health Digest. “I’ve eaten eggs two months past their sell-by date. They just don’t have the quality that they once had.” OK, sure, but let’s say you eat that two-month-past-its-expiration-date egg. Are side effects possible? “Even if an egg is free from pathogens, consuming a spoiled egg can lead to unpleasant physical reactions due to its breakdown products,” Detwiler said. Those reactions include stomach and gastrointestinal tract issues such as nausea, cramping, diarrhea, gag reflex, vomiting, and bloating. Purdy said consumers would experience these symptoms within three days of eating the spoiled egg. “By using proper storage and common sense, the risk of negative effects from older eggs is low,” Detwiler said. If you had assumed that most eggs in the U.S. are pasteurized, you guessed wrong. Less than 3% of eggs in the U.S. are pasteurized (because it takes too long and requires a lot of hot water), but the Department of Agriculture does require liquid egg whites to be pasteurized. The process kills bacteria, bird flu and salmonella. “Just make sure you’re cooking your eggs thoroughly in order to kill any harmful bacteria or viruses that might be present,” Balls said. “Eating raw cookie dough with eggs in it, or eating eggs fried sunny-side up or over easy may still contain salmonella and bird flu, if present. If an egg has salmonella or bird flu, eating them before or after their sell-by date won’t protect you from it.” Best said it’s OK to eat the eggs post-expiration date as long as consumers “pay attention to indicators like runny whites, off smell and strange flavors.” She recommends the float test. “Place the questionable egg in water, and if it floats, it is most likely spoiled and unsafe to eat.” Basically, the longer you wait to eat eggs, the less fresh they’ll be. No matter when you decide to eat the eggs, make sure you’re cooking them thoroughly and at a high-enough temp. The USDA suggests cooking eggs at 160 degrees Fahrenheit to kill bacteria. “Scrambled eggs should be cooked until firm,” Detwiler said. “Fried eggs should have fully cooked whites and yolks. Dishes like casseroles or quiches should reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F before serving.” Whether you’re buying free-range eggs from the store or pastured-raised from a farmers market, the type of egg — except from a nutritional standpoint — kind of matters.

Detwiler explained that locally farmed eggs might be fresher than store-bought, but, “They could carry a slightly higher risk of contamination if not stored or handled properly,” he said. Commercial eggs tend to be washed more, but consumers also should beware. “The industrial washing process can sometimes make the shells more porous, increasing the importance of proper refrigeration,” he said. “Store eggs in the coldest part of the refrigerator and keep them in their original carton to minimize contamination and preserve freshness. Purchase eggs from reputable sources with clear safety protocols, especially during times of increased bird flu concerns.” This story has been updated to reflect that a source corrected her statement to note that fresh eggs are slightly alkaline.

    "text": "We could all benefit from fewer tasks on our hands. An increasingly popular helper for single folks and families alike? The robot vacuum. Once utterly futuristic, robot vacuums are now mainstream enough to offer reliable, tech-powered cleaning at pricing that’s actually pretty accessible, especially if you really could use a helping hand around the house and know you’d use the device. Yet with so many robo vacuums now available, it can be difficult — and downright overwhelming — to tell the models apart, much less figure out which one is best suited for your home. At its most basic, a good robot vacuum will clean your home with limited interference from you — moving about your home and absorbing dirt and debris while avoiding obstacles like stairs and furniture. Models with more bells and whistles may also recharge and empty themselves, remember the specific contours of your home or even mop. We’ve assembled a list of Amazon’s bestselling robot vacuums, with their key features and differences, to help make the selection process easier for you. Spoiler alert: If you’re willing to shell out a little extra for a vacuum that’s exceptionally thorough, the Shark Matrix is the one to get, with precision grid cleaning that methodically grabs every last piece of dirt. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Highlights: Targeted spot cleaning, three cleaning power modes, corner and edge cleaning, automatic recharging, scheduled cleaning, voice command, app control Amazon’s current bestselling robot vacuum, the Roomba Q0120, is the iRobot brand’s self-described “Essential” vacuum. The device combines smart navigation with a slim body and three levels of powerful suction (that’s 18 times more powerful than previous Roomba 600 models, according to the brand). At just over three inches high, the robot will fit easily under most furniture, while the device’s sensors help it navigate around objects and stairs. The Q0120 will do the most important things on its own — it’s designed to automatically recharge itself and generates reports that show where the vacuum cleaned while you were out, so you’ll know it did its job. Drawbacks: No self-emptying of debris, lacks brushes specifically suited for pet hair Bottom line: The Roomba Q0120 does everything you actually want your robot vacuum to do — effectively clean, including via schedule — with extra spot-cleaning capabilities. Highlights: Quiet, slim, automatic recharging, edge and spot cleaning, great for carpets, uses a remote control Amazon’s current number two bestselling robot vacuum, the Eufy 11S Max, is an exceptionally quiet and slim pick: At 2.85 inches high with a microwave-level 55 dB sound, this model is designed to do its job without keeping you up at night or getting stuck under furniture. Designed with obstacle-avoiding, versatile flooring tech, the robot can confidently move between hard and carpeted flooring (including medium-pile!) while avoiding falling downstairs. A plus for some, the Eufy 11S Max is controlled by remote — so you won’t have to download an app (but, that means you can’t control the vacuum from another room). You can also operate the device manually via the \"on\" button on the top of the robot, which prompts an automatic cleaning cycle. Drawbacks: Slightly lower runtime than Roomba models (100 minutes versus 120 minutes), can only be operated manually or by remote control Bottom line: Notable benefits include its comparatively low sound, thin profile and powerful suction, particularly on carpeting. Its app-free, remote control operation will be a plus for some and a drawback for others. Clip the on-page coupon to get an extra $52 off. Savings will show up at checkout. Highlights: Auto-emptying, auto-recharging, four cleaning power modes, spot cleaning, voice and app control Think of the Roomba Essential Vac 2 like a super-charged version of the Essential Q0120: The 2.0 version has twice the suction power, so it’ll deliver a truly spotless clean, and empties its own waste into an enclosed bag for up to 60 days before you have to take the trash out. The Essential 2 takes auto-recharging one step further, too, able to pause cleaning for a re-juice and then return to finish its job. Drawbacks: Lacks brushes specifically for suited for pet hair, requires a waste bag for self-emptying Bottom line: If you’re seeking an independent robot vacuum that’ll take even more tasks off your hands, the Essential 2 is a good pick, thanks to its auto-recharging and self-emptying features. Highlights: Brushless suction (ideal for pets), voice and app control, scheduling in advance, automatic recharging, six cleaning modes, anti-collision sensors Because the Lefant M210 robot vacuum cleans without a brush, it’s an ideal choice for folks with pets or who themselves tend to shed a lot of hair — the brushless suction means you won’t have to deal with malfunctions due to tangled up hair and tacky fur. Through the Lefant app, you can customize the robot’s cleaning, scheduling tasks in advance, adjusting suction power and routing and more. (Just be sure that you are using the newest version of the Lefant app, called Lefant, not Lefant Life.) You can also control the robot vacuum by voice. The device’s six modes are especially versatile compared to peer models, and at just under three inches and under a foot in diameter, the robot is well-suited to unobtrusively ducking under your furniture. Petite and versatile, this robot vacuum is a great starter vac — especially if you can grab it while it’s on sale (for an exceptional 50% off). According to one of our trackers, the price drops regularly. Drawbacks: Lacks self-emptying feature Bottom line: The Lefant M210’s brushless cleaning makes it uniquely suited for hair- and fur-heavy households, eliminating the tangling problems characteristic of peer models’ roller brushes. Clip the on-page coupon to get an extra $90 off. Savings show up at checkout. Highlights: Unique precision-grid cleaning, bagless self-emptying, automatic recharging, spot cleaning, app control with scheduled cleaning and voice control For folks seeking a truly deep cleaning robot vacuum, the Shark Matrix RV2310AE is an excellent choice: The device cleans each spot in your home multiple times using its precision grid method, which ensures every bit of dirt and grime is accounted for — and not a single spot is missed. Its deep cleaning prowess is further strengthened by the vacuum’s smart mapping feature, which learns the position of furniture in your home for enhanced meticulous cleaning while helping the vac avoid obstacles. The device is designed to tackle pet hair without a fuss due to its self-cleaning, anti-tangle brush roll; its suction power can draw out fur and debris from carpets and hard flooring. Plus, the Shark Matrix self-empties, can hold up to 45 days' worth of collected debris in its bagless base (which also frees you from having to spend money on disposable bags). Drawbacks: Use a roller brush (though is designed to avoid hair tangling), slightly higher price point Bottom line: This Shark model is excellent cost-effective buy for folks seeking a high-powered model at the best price possible — in other words, it’s great bang for your buck. Highlights: Mopping capability, multi-surface and anti-tangle brushes, smart mapping, app control with scheduling and voice commands, self-emptying, child and pet lock With a switch of its bin, the Roomba i5 converts from an all-floor vacuum to a mop and vacuum, allowing it to adjust to your cleaning needs while taking less time to get the job done. The device mops with less mess than you’d imagine due to its microfiber mop pad, and is designed to understands more voice commands than other two-in-one robot vacuums, according to the iRobot brand. Thanks to its smart mapping, you can have the device specific areas and rooms of your home at any time you want; when functioning as a vacuum (with the mop bin swapped out), the i5 can also detect especially dirty areas of your home and treat them to an extra-deep clean. Plus, the device empties itself and automatically docks to recharge, so you can take its basic care off your plate. Drawbacks: Will not replace deep-cleaning mopping, requires a waste bag for self-emptying Bottom line: At under $300 for vacuuming and mopping, this model is impressively cost-effective and an obvious choice for budget-conscious shoppers looking for a robot vacuum that can handle wet floors, too.

    "title": "How A Humidifier Can Help (And Harm) Your Skin This Winter",
    "text": "Google Trends reports often inform us of what people are searching for online at any given time, and ever since winter’s chill has set in, a hugely popular search has been humidifiers and the benefits of them for your skin. Humidifiers can have a positive impact on your skin, but there can also be some negative side effects. We spoke to four dermatologists and one aesthetician to understand the pros and cons. Dry air, which is quite common in certain geographic locations in the winter, can severely affect skin health. Dr. Howard Sobel, a clinical attending cosmetic dermatologic surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital, said dry air strips the skin of its natural oils, degrading the moisture barrier and leading to peeling, cracking or flaking of the skin. Plus, dehydrated, peeling skin and a damaged moisture barrier can create issues with protection of the skin against bacteria and pollutants, as well as transepidermal water loss, inflammation and sensitivity. The air moisture levels can be an issue in both summer and winter, as central heating and air conditioning equally dry out the skin; depending on your location and humidity levels, you might need a humidifier year-round. A dry, hot indoor environment can cause dehydration and itchy skin on the face and body, including the hair and eyes. According to Elizabeth Manessis, aesthetician and owner of Zeta Aesthetics in New York, people with skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis and rosacea suffer the most. “The ideal humidity for skin health is between 40% and 60%. This can help prevent water loss, which leads to dry, flaky skin,” said Dr. Jordan Staples, a board-certified dermatologist at Westlake Dermatology. Maintaining the optimal indoor humidity levels can also support the skin’s barrier. “It allows the skin to retain sufficient moisture to maintain its barrier function without becoming overly dehydrated. Too little humidity can cause dryness, while excess humidity could create an environment for microbial overgrowth,” said Dr. Aleksandra Brown, a board-certified dermatologist and managing partner at River Ridge Dermatology. First, follow the instructions for your own humidifier. The experts recommend keeping it in the room you spend the most time in, like your living room or bedroom. You don’t have to be very close to it as long as you purchase one according to the square footage of your room. “They should be placed at least 3 feet away and in a room where you spend most of your time,” Staples said. Using a humidifier overnight while you sleep (for six to eight hours) may be beneficial, Staples added. “The skin’s repair and hydration mechanisms are most active overnight,” Brown added. Generally speaking, humidifiers can help people of all skin types, but they may be particularly beneficial for combating dry skin, eczema, psoriasis and sensitive skin. “These conditions love dry environments, so increased humidity can alleviate symptoms and minimize flare-ups and discomfort,” Manessis said. “Indoor humidity levels between 40 and 60% can reduce eczema flares by up to 30%. Even normal skin shows improved barrier function in properly humidified environments,” said Dr. Kunal Malik, a board-certified cosmetic and medical dermatologist. In terms of wrinkles and fine lines, although a humidifier doesn’t directly get rid of them, it can minimize them thanks to the addition of moisture in the skin. Distilled and demineralized water is preferred to ensure the humidifier works well and doesn’t exacerbate any skin conditions. Tap water may not be safe to use, as minerals can form white dust that irritates sensitive skin or lungs. “Minerals from hard water may also clog the humidifier, reducing its effectiveness,” Brown said. The ideal type of humidifier depends on a few factors. The experts agreed that cool mist humidifiers are the best solution to hydrate the skin and are generally easier to clean and regulate. Warm mist humidifiers are equally beneficial but may lead to burns if tipped over, as they use boiling water, hence they aren’t that safe around children or pets. Finally, Manessis noted that a multipurpose humidifier, which is a style that’s popular in Europe, may also be a good choice. “They have multiple functions, such as humidifier, air purifier, HEPA filters all in one and can adjust the humidity levels in the room as well as detect dust particles and bacteria in the air,” she said. The experts agreed that cleaning the device often is very important to avoid adverse reactions to your skin and lungs. After daily use, you can simply empty and rinse it. Deep clean it weekly with a vinegar-based solution, and ideally every three days. “If humidifiers aren’t regularly cleaned, you can get a buildup of bacteria or fungus in the device, which can lead to worsening allergies or asthma,” said Staples. Check out this great detailed guide on how to clean a humidifier. Experts said it’s broadly safe to use a humidifier, but you should be more careful if you have allergies, asthma or seborrheic dermatitis. “If it is hot and humid outside, it is not beneficial to run a humidifier indoors as this can lead to mold and mildew growth” Staples added. Mold, bacteria, dust mites and fungus can create respiratory infections, skin irritations and breakouts, as well as asthma or allergies. Anyone with severe asthma or allergies should consult a doctor before using a humidifier, Malik warned. “Over-humidification (above 60%) can create an environment that promotes dust mites and mold growth. Additionally, using contaminated water can lead to microorganisms in the air,” he added. “People with severe allergies or mold sensitivity should monitor the humidity level to prevent overuse,” Manessis said. But overall, if you clean your humidifier regularly and keep the humidity levels under 60%, you’re in good shape.

Super quiet and we have it in our living room and already notice a huge difference with the air quality.\" — Misha Stange At first glance, this option may look more like a storage container or ottoman than a humidifier. Yet, from the brand Carepod, this TikTok-loved cube-shaped humidifier offers cool and warm mist with a 4.2-liter tank. Easily break it down into three parts (that are all easy to clean), with an automatic shut-off when the water is low. Promising review: \"This humidifier is the best! Firstly, it is easy to clean with only three parts to wash, making maintenance a breeze. Additionally, it is dishwasher safe for added convenience.

We live in VT and rely on wood stove heat all winter. Using other brand machines we are refilling every 6-8 hours of use. This one, on highest level, lasts at least 12-15 hours. We love that it doesn’t spew a thick cloud and still is noticeably different in our living and dining room, both. Worth the money for that, the easy to clean tank (why is that not the standard ?!?) and the time it lasts on.\" — kassandra S. While proper humidity is the goal, Brown says you want to be sure not to overdo it, as over-humidifying a space can actually make it harder to breathe and can encourage mold to grow. Per the EPA, you want the humidity level in your home to be ideally around 30-50%. How the heck can you tell if you’ve achieved that? A hygrometer is basically a thermometer for humility and tells you the percentage. This highly-rated option also gives you the temperature of your home, allowing you to really be in tune with what's happening. While some of the fancier models on our list have humidity sensors built-in, this is a great add-on if you're buying a budget model with fewer features, and you can use it in your home year-round. Promising review: \"This takes up little room, and I can move it about from room to room. It is accurate. Well worth the few dollars to buy.\" — Susan Clare By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Everyone's Favorite Convenient Portable Power Station Is 35% Off Right Now On Amazon",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. The Jackery Explorer 300 is one device that many avid campers, survivalists and emergency preppers all swear by for running vital appliances and juicing up all their essential devices when regular power sources are not available. Currently on sale at Amazon for an impressive 35% off (nearly $100 off!), this gas-free portable power station, which has even been on the must-have lists of our own HuffPost editors, uses a 293Wh lithium ion battery pack to offer a safe and steady supply of energy to everything from laptops to fans. HuffPost Shopping writer Griffin Wynne called their own Jackery “my greatest asset” and uses it to power up their griddle on camping trips or keep the fan going during rolling summer blackouts. Featuring two AC outlets, a USB-C and two USB-A ports, this Jackery model can charge up to six devices at once and takes only two hours to recharge 80% of its battery power, which can be done using a regular AC adapter, your car outlet or even with solar panels (sold separately). Thanks to its perfectly compact and handled design, this device can be easily stored in your car, packed along with camping gear or kept safe in the event of a power outage. Even if you’re not an outdoors person or emergency preparedness enthusiast, you might find it useful to invest in this potentially lifesaving tool while it’s discounted. But, if you need more convincing, see why others are happy they made the Jackery purchase below. “I’d have to say. This thing is being used a lot more than I intended. From camping trips to daily use at work. I am a construction worker(electrician) . So often times, believe it or not. We work with no electricity. Since we turn everything off to be safe. So this little thing can power anything from a portable clip on lamps to a small fan to help light up and cool down hot electric rooms. The job I am on right now is a ground up job. Meaning it’s nothing but dirt. All the old power we ripped out. So the only power on site are the spider boxes(corded power) connected to the utility. They’re not convenient what so ever. […] I use this to charge stuff daily like my radio and head lamp at the end of the day. Saves me from hauling my tool cart which is a solid 80 pounds over ruff terrain just to get to a power box. And with only 1 microwave for 20 guys at 2 minutes each. It’s almost pointless in waiting to heat up your food. So this little jackery is wonderful. I can plug in my 12v food warmer and get nice hot food prior to start of lunch.!!!! I am able to charge my ear buds daily. […]” — Dirk (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.)  “I was very, very skeptical about these at first — and I was raised to be able to do whatever I needed to do in the wilds if it came to that. Personal experiences made me very antsy about being able to keep going even when things are at their worst. I decided to stay adaptable and so I picked up a unit and 100w solar panel. The timing was rather great, as I had a power outage right after. I get a lot of sun here, and was able to charge one up in about 4 to 5 hours. I liked it so much I bought another. Then I bought the 500, and still don’t like it very much, so picked up a third 300 and now I run my internet off one while charging devices on a second and then using my laptop with a third while the spare charges. I absolutely love these. The 300 is super portable, even for my 60 year old or so self, and they charge super fast. They are really quiet, too — even when the fan comes on, it is short, and very soft. The quality of the units is really great — very sturdy. I would suggest a cover for them if you go to places where it rains a lot or is very, very dusty though. Their capacity is great — my cable modem and WiFi last an entire day and night on one — turn it off, and you can get two days out of it! The solar panel is great — I get 70 w pretty consistently out of it, and on the 500 it is much slower at 50 watts. I did get a second panel, but not by the same folks, so I can keep up with charging.” — Dyssonance  “This is a game changer. I got it right before hurricane Milton passed. It came at a good time. So easy to use. Itbkeep a charge for longe time too. I now feel so much better knowing I have some power to light my house in use small appliances, or radio even kept the fan going. Price is good too. Easy to store. You just plug up and good to go. Happy I have this Jackery.” — Rene Brown  “Have had this for 2 years now, I bought it to power my CPAP when camping or touring on the motorcycle across the states. Will power my CPAP for 3 nights before needing charged. When on the motorcycle, I carry it in the saddlebag that has a 12V outlet and it charges during the day as I ride. When using it in the camper when we are boondocking, I charge it off the 12VDC battery as we travel to the next site. Will easily power my CPAP and charge phones for several nights. Very happy with it. Has worked flawlessly on about 6 trips over the last 2 years.” — Kevin Maki By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "James Carville Admits He Was Wrong About A Kamala Harris Victory, Offers Dems Advice",
    "text": "Longtime political strategist James Carville acknowledged Thursday that he was wrong in predicting Vice President Kamala Harris would win the election, and offered suggestions on how Democrats can move forward following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. “We lost for one very simple reason: It was, it is and it always will be the economy, stupid,” Carville, 80, wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times, echoing his popular catchphrase. Carville, nicknamed the “Ragin’ Cajun,” was a top strategist in Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in the 1990s. He also reportedly played a role in President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race last year before passing the baton to Harris, who ultimately lost to Trump. “Mr. Trump, for the first time in his political career, decisively won by seizing a swath of middle-class and low-income voters focused on the economy. Democrats have flat-out lost the economic narrative,” Carville wrote in his Times piece. “The only path to electoral salvation is to take it back. Perception is everything in politics, and a lot of Americans perceive us as out to lunch on the economy — not feeling their pain or caring too much about other things instead.” Carville called on Democrats to “force Republicans to oppose us” over the next several years as they accentuate certain problems — such as immigration and the overturning of Roe v. Wade — as economic issues. “This year the Democratic Party leadership must convene and publish a creative, popular and bold economic agenda and proactively take back our economic turf,” Carville wrote. “Go big, go populist, stick to economic progress and force them to oppose what they cannot be for.” He also urged Democrats to shift their focus from Trump and his extremist movement to the Republican Party as a whole, especially since Trump cannot be elected for a third time. Carville claimed that the Democratic Party and its 2028 presidential nominee must also be adept at getting information out to the general population as the media landscape evolves — particularly through podcasts. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read. While other outlets are retreating behind paywalls and bending the knee to political pressure, HuffPost is proud to be unbought and unfiltered. Will you help us keep it that way?

    "title": "James Carville Shares Suspicions About Jeff Bezos And $40 Million Melania Trump Film",
    "text": "James Carville said he’s stunned that Amazon is spending $40 million to license a documentary on Melania Trump but suggested Thursday that the sum is merely a poorly veiled gift from founder Jeff Bezos to President-elect Donald Trump and his wife. “What’s happening right in front of your fucking eyes, right there, they’re paying her $40 million,” said Carville in a video for Politicon. “I don’t know; somebody better look into this. They could make a documentary on the history of the universe and not spend $40 million.” Bezos has grown increasingly chummy with Trump. The Washington Post owner pulled a Post endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of November’s election and congratulated Trump on winning. And Amazon has announced a $1 million donation to Trump’s inauguration. Carville, a longtime Democratic strategist who warned of the dangers of another Trump term in the Oval Office, freely shared his suspicions Thursday about this latest payment, which an Amazon spokesperson told Variety on Sunday is for the former first lady’s “truly unique story.” The documentary is reportedly being co-executive produced by Melania Trump. “This is something I’m going to claim some expertise in, the subject of documentaries, because I’ve been the subject of two, and I’ve been the subject of a recent one,” Carville said Thursday, noting, “You can produce a world-class documentary for $2 million.” “You couldn’t spend $40 million on a documentary if you tried 10 times harder to do it, so where’s the money going?” he added. “Well, we know where the money is going. And to Bezos, who’s worth, I don’t know, $400 billion or something, this is all chump change.” Bezos stepped down as Amazon’s CEO in 2021 but remains the executive chair. According to Bloomberg’s index of the 500 richest people, Bezos has a net worth of $241 billion — trailing only Trump acolyte Elon Musk and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Carville noted that ABC agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library in December to settle a defamation lawsuit. He argued that because “Bezos is richer,” the billionaire decided on a much larger payment to license the Melania Trump film. “It’s breathtaking,” Carville said. The documentary is being directed by Brett Ratner, who faced numerous sexual misconduct allegations in 2017 at the height of the #MeToo movement — and hasn’t directed a feature film since 2014’s critically panned “Hercules.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "'The Find Out Phase': Jasmine Crockett Taunts GOP 'Clown Show' Amid Speaker Drama",
    "text": "Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) said ahead of Friday’s precarious House speaker vote that Republicans are entering the “‘find out’ phase” after claiming they’d received a sweeping “mandate” from voters in November. Crockett said Democrats don’t plan to help them sort it out. “Listen, they have gone around, they have talked about how there is a mandate, and that this country issued a mandate for the Republicans to run something,” she told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi on Thursday. “Well, the country about to find out. We are in the ‘find out’ phase.” “So go ahead and run whatever y’all gonna run,” she continued, “but listen, if it’s all about y’all, if you don’t believe in bipartisanship and you have a ‘Trump trifecta,’ then y’all work this out amongst yourselves. We’re going to sit on the sidelines and eat our popcorn.” In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, Crockett wrote: “Welcome to the 119th! America, y’all seriously voted for this clown show to continue?!” Welcome to the 119th! America, y’all seriously voted for this clown show to continue?! 🤯Tune in for all the drama on CSPAN. Remember, 2 years ago things got physical on the R side as they tried to get a speaker. Who knows what will happen this time. If 2 people, Massie plus… https://t.co/cR3WymIRGq She offered a flashback to this time in 2023, when it took former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) 15 rounds to get the speaker’s gavel. He was ousted from his leadership post later that year, leading to a three-week civil war among Republicans until they ultimately settled on Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) to replace him. Johnson now faces his own uphill battle to retain the position when the new Congress convenes on Friday. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has said he won’t vote for Johnson, and with a razor-thin GOP majority in the House, any such defection puts Johnson’s speakership on the brink.

President-elect Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind Johnson. Congress can’t certify the results of the 2024 election until a speaker is elected.

    "title": "JD Vance Leaves 'Gray Area' For How Trump Will Pardon Jan. 6 Prisoners",
    "text": "JD Vance’s plan for pardoning the right Jan. 6 prisoners doesn’t sound as “simple” as he says. Though Vice President-elect Vance told “Fox News Sunday” that people who “committed violence” during the 2021 insurrection at the Capitol “obviously” shouldn’t be pardoned, he offered some interesting exceptions in a social media post later on Sunday. During his conversation with anchor Shannon Bream, the former senator from Ohio tried to draw a distinction between two types of protesters who descended upon the U.S. Capitol Building on Jan. 6. “I think it’s very simple. Look, if you protested peacefully on Jan. 6, and you had Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned,” he told Bream. “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.” “There’s a little bit of a gray area there,” Vance noted, however. WATCH: @JDVance lays out President-elect Trump’s pardon process for January 6th participants. Tune in tomorrow for the rest of Shannon's exclusive interview with Vice President-elect JD Vance. pic.twitter.com/RvqXrL6rO3 “But we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law, and there are a lot of people we think in the wake of Jan. 6 who were prosecuted unfairly,” he went on. “We need to rectify that.” Vance seemed to shed light on what he meant by “gray area” while responding to a critic on X, formerly Twitter, not long after his interview aired. Though the “Hillbilly Elegy” author described “violence” as the dividing line that morning on TV, online he said Jan. 6 participants who were “provoked” or had “garbage trials” should also be considered for pardons from President-elect Donald Trump. While reminding everyone that he’s “been defending these guys for years” and has even donated to Jan. 6 defense funds, he wrote about “federal informants in the crowd.” “Do they get a pardon? I don’t think so,” he said. “The president saying he’ll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walkback.” “I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up,” Vance continued. “Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

During a December interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the incoming president said freeing his followers would be a priority on his “first day” in office but that he would stop short of pardoning people who acted “radical” or “crazy” during the chaos.

    "title": "Jean Smart Posts Bold Idea For LA Fire Donations And People Seem To Like It",
    "text": "Actor Jean Smart on Wednesday urged upcoming award shows to cancel their telecasts and give what would have been their profits to victims of the fires engulfing Los Angeles. Smart, who on Sunday won a Golden Globe for her role on “Hacks,” headlined her plea on Instagram with the word “ATTENTION!” “With ALL due respect, during Hollywood’s season of celebration, I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have garnered to victims of the fires and the firefighters,” the “Designing Women” alum wrote. A post shared by Jean Smart (@realjeansmart) The novel idea received numerous positive responses, including a “You’re my Hero” from actor Bonnie Somerville. But some expressed concern that the shows would have nothing to donate without the ad revenue created by televising them. One commenter suggested that the award shows be used as fundraisers in a telethon setup. Some of the shows approaching are the now-postponed Critics Choice Awards, the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the Grammys and of course the Oscars. The latter’s nomination announcement ceremony was already delayed a few days to Jan. 19 due to the fires. A blaze ignited in the Hollywood Hills Wednesday night as wildfires from the Pacific coast to Pasadena had killed at least five people and resulted in evacuation orders for at least 130,000, The Associated Press reported.

    "text": "Jeremy Strong’s bold Golden Globes look is being likened to everything from “maritime chic” to “Paddington cosplay” and the “ecstasy dealer of Emerald City.” The “Succession” star walked the red carpet in a teal Loro Piana suit at Sunday’s awards show, paired with complementary tinted frames, a white turtleneck and the pièce de résistance: a matching bucket hat. Strong won his first Golden Globe in 2022 for his performance as Kendall Roy in the “Succession” drama series. He was nominated this year for his supporting role in “The Apprentice.” His former co-star, Kieran Culkin, ended up nabbing the prize in the movie category for “A Real Pain.” But Strong, usually known to have an affinity for the color brown when it comes to fashion, stole the show with his outfit — which looked particularly outrageous when he was seated at the ceremony: On the red carpet, Strong ran into “Ripley” star Andrew Scott, who went for a similarly daring shade of pale blue with his own suit. “You look so good,” Scott told Strong. “Pastel universe,” Strong quipped. “We’re the colors of the sea,” Scott added. “We’re maritime chic.” Andrew Scott and Jeremy Strong have a meeting of the blue suits at the #GoldenGlobes . 💙🩵 pic.twitter.com/IbaNfrjzSL Social media users mostly loved the look and had their fun with it.

    "title": "Jesse Eisenberg Has 1 Big Question For Tech Execs Like Mark Zuckerberg",
    "text": "Jesse Eisenberg had a pointed response on Friday when Bill Maher asked him for his take on powerful “tech bros.” The “Real Time” host noted that the actor famously portrayed Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in the 2010 movie “The Social Network.” “I see Zuckerberg now at the inauguration, and he’s right at the seat of power,” Maher said. The Meta CEO, along with fellow tech billionaires Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Elon Musk, enjoyed prominent placement at President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday, with better seats than many elected officials. Maher also observed that in the 2016 movie “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” Eisenberg chose to “kind of” play supervillain Lex Luthor as a “tech bro.” Surmising that Eisenberg “must have some feelings” on the topic, Maher asked, “What do you make of all that’s going on with the tech bros?” Eisenberg, who wrote, directed and starred in this year’s comedy-drama “A Real Pain,” responded with a question of his own. “I look at it from a very specific perspective, which is, just like, if you’re so rich and powerful, why are you not just spending your days doing good things for the world?” He cited his wife, Anna Strout, as an “amazing activist” whose commitment to helping other people has shaped his perspective. Her mother founded the Middle Way House, a nonprofit for survivors of domestic violence, trafficking and sexual assault, and Strout and Eisenberg are volunteers and fundraisers. “And so when I watch these like incredibly powerful people, I just think like, wait, why are you not spending your day helping people?” Eisenberg asked. “Why are you like getting mired into this weird stuff ― stuff I don’t really understand ― and taking, you know, privacy concerns away, hurting people who are already hurting, marginalized people?” He continued, “I can’t even understand that, so I’m not exactly thinking about them in politics. I’m just thinking, ‘Why are they not spending every day helping people?’” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

However, on Tuesday, he criticized Zuckerberg’s decision to ditch the fact-checking system on Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta. “Now that the platform is so powerful and owns all these other things, I guess I feel a little bit sad,” he told NPR’s Terry Gross. “Why is this the path you’re taking?” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Jewel Says She Sang At Trump Inauguration Event To Advocate For Mental Health",
    "text": "Jewel is explaining why she thinks it’s OK to cozy up to MAGA. On Saturday, the Grammy-nominated folk singer, full name Jewel Kilcher, posted a video to Instagram in which she responded to fans who were disgusted by her decision to perform at one of President Donald Trump’s inauguration events. “Let’s talk,” Jewel begins in the clip. “As many of you know, I am a mental health advocate. If there’s anything that I’ve learned in the past 20 years, it’s that mental health affects everybody’s lives across party lines.” She goes on to say she “reached out to the last administration” to discuss more advocacy for mental health, to no avail. “If I wait to try until I agree 100% with the people that might be willing to help me, I’d never get off the bench,” she says. “I don’t think that’s how activism works. Waiting until everything’s perfect enough to participate ― it’s actually because things are so imperfect that we have to find ways to engage and to participate, and we have to act now. We cannot wait another four years.” “I believe there are people in the new administration that are willing to help on this issue,” the singer continues. “I do not agree on all the politics, but if I can help shape policy, make sure mental health is in the conversation when it comes to American health, if I can help put resources or mental health tools into the hands of the most vulnerable who need it, I’m going to try, and I’m going to fight.” A post shared by Jewel (@jewel) Last week, fans of the “Who Will Save Your Soul” singer were shocked when she delivered a surprise performance at the “Make America Healthy Again” ball hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In a clip posted to X, formerly Twitter, Kennedy teases Jewel’s appearance by telling the crowd they’re in for “a special treat.” “About a week ago I got a call from a woman who is Cheryl’s favorite musical artist in her whole life,” Kennedy says in the clip, referring to his wife, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” alum Cheryl Hines, who is also on stage. “And she said to me, ‘I want to come and sing to the crowd tonight.’” Jewel takes the stage and thanks Kennedy for “sacrificing so much to make America healthy again,” before launching into a cover of “Over the Rainbow” — a song that she says “sums up the hope that founded America, and that I think we’re all feeling again.” Considering that Kennedy has spread anti-vaccine misinformation and other conspiracy theories for decades, many of Jewel’s longtime fans were outraged when clips of her inaugural performance began to circulate on social media. Many fans flooded the comment section of one of Jewel’s latest Instagram posts — which shows her participating in a panel discussion about mental health and the role of artificial intelligence in wellness — to express their disapproval. “Hanging out with RFK Jr but claiming to care about public health is next level hypocrisy,” one Instagram user wrote. “How is YOUR mental health, Jewel, knowing you’re supporting a movement that endangers lives and will only increase the despair and suicide rates among LGBTQ+ individuals?” another person commented. “It’s gross that you would lend your name and talent to celebrate that man and his vile, inhumane movement,” someone else wrote. “Hope the check was worth it.” Jewel posing with RFK… girl, who will save YOUR soul? The pushback prompted Jewel to release her video on Saturday. In it, she acknowledged the political divide in the U.S. — and sympathized with both sides. “Half of our country feels hope right now, and I honor that,” she said. “And half of our country feels disenfranchised and scared and vulnerable, and that is unacceptable.” She then apologized specifically to her fans in the wider LGBTQ community. “I am so sorry that I caused pain, especially in my LGBTQIA+ community, because you guys are treasures,” Jewel said. “You make the world a better place. You’ve made my life a better place, and I will not stop fighting.” Trump has already signed at least one executive order that is negatively affecting the LGBTQ+ community. In her video Saturday, Jewel implored her fans on both sides of the political spectrum to keep everything kumbaya. “None of us can afford to stop fighting, and I really believe that the only way we change is in relationship,” she said. “It isn’t in isolation or by isolating, it’s by being in relationship, by reaching out, by having hard conversations. And I really hope that we can push through our hurt and move toward understanding on both sides.” Many people on social media didn’t quite buy Jewel’s rationale for aligning with MAGA. Below, you can see some of the responses to her statement. Ah yes, ‘so sorry for the pain’—right after the check cleared. Truly a heroic sacrifice to sing your heart out at a controversial event. What a heartfelt apology… or was that just another lyric? 🤣 I won't listen to anything she has to say. Anyone who performed, and does so in the future is an accomplice to this fascist regime that is causing havoc, and fear throughout our country. These performers are complicit, and normalizing this cruelty. It’s cute how she thinks an administration that wants to eliminate health insurance, does warrantlessImmigration raids, treats women’s rights like shit, and eliminates whole DEI departments somehow cares about mental health. This might be true in a normal transition of power but this isn't normal and should never be treated as if it were. So…Jewel can suck rocks. Care about mental health soooo much, but preformed for a man who is going to dismantle the HHS with his INSANE views. Fuck all the way off. pic.twitter.com/kG6KiJt7yB Performing a song at an event isn’t a seat at the table to discuss mental health policy issues. There isn’t even a possibly here, so this reasoning makes no sense. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "text": "Jimmy Kimmel took another shot at President Donald Trump’s relationship with his wife, Melania Trump, with footage of their arrival in California last week to see the damage caused by a series of wildfires. The Trumps were met on the airport tarmac by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), whom the president has frequently attacked. But Kimmel had another theory. “Now I happen to believe that Trump likes Gavin Newsom,” Kimmel said. “I think he looks at Gavin Newsom, he’s like, ‘Damn you, Don Jr., why can’t you...’” Kimmel showed the two engaged in conversation and tried to translate what they were saying. But it’s what happened next that really caught Kimmel’s attention: As the president turned to walk away, Newsom and the first lady shook hands and exchanged a kiss on the cheek. “Hello, Melania!” Kimmel said. “The happiest she’s been in quite some time.” Newsom and Trump then spoke to reporters. “The governor did his best to make nice, he said in front of reporters to the president, he said, ‘You were there for us during COVID and we won’t forget it,’” Kimmel said. “Which is like telling Michael Myers he was there for us [in] ‘Halloween’ and we won’t forget it.” See more in his Monday night monologue.

    "title": "Senate Confirms John Ratcliffe To Lead CIA",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Thursday confirmed John Ratcliffe as CIA director, giving President Donald Trump the second member of his new Cabinet. Ratcliffe was director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term and is the first person to have held that position and the top post at the CIA, the nation’s premier spy agency. The Texas Republican is a former federal prosecutor who emerged as a fierce Trump defender while serving as a congressman during Trump’s first impeachment. The vote was 74-25. At his Senate hearing last week, Ratcliffe said the CIA must do better when it comes to using technology such as artificial intelligence to confront adversaries including Russia and China. He said the United States needed to improve its intelligence capabilities while also ensuring the protection of Americans’ civil rights. Ratcliffe said that if confirmed, he would push the CIA to do more to harness technologies such as AI and quantum computing while expanding use of human intelligence collection. “We’re not where we’re supposed to be,” Ratcliffe told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Democrats raised questions about Ratcliffe’s objectivity and whether his loyalty to Trump would prompt him to politicize his position and blind him to the duties of the job. Concerns from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., forced the Senate’s Republican leaders to postpone Ratcliffe’s confirmation vote, which originally was scheduled for Tuesday. Former Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was confirmed earlier this week as secretary of state, the first member of Trump’s Cabinet. Ratcliffe has said he views China as America’s greatest geopolitical rival, and that Russia, Iran, North Korea and drug cartels, hacking gangs and terrorist organizations also pose challenges to national security. He supports the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a government spying program that allows authorities to collect without warrant the communications of non-Americans outside the country. If those people are communicating with Americans, those conversations can be swept up, too, which has led to questions about violations of personal rights. Trump and other Republicans have criticized the work of the CIA and other spy agencies, saying they have focused too much on climate change, workforce diversity and other issues. The calls for a broad overhaul have worried some current and former intelligence officials who say the changes could make the country less safe. Like other Trump nominees, Ratcliffe is a Trump loyalist. Aside from his work to defend Trump during his first impeachment proceedings, Ratcliffe also forcefully questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller when he testified before lawmakers about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. As director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe oversaw and coordinated the work of more than a dozen spy agencies. Among other duties, the office directs efforts to detect and counter foreign efforts to influence U.S. politics. Trump picked Ratcliffe to serve in that position in 2019, but he quickly withdrew from consideration after lawmakers raised questions about his qualifications. He was ultimately confirmed by a sharply divided Senate after Trump resubmitted the nomination. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, has faced bipartisan criticism over past comments supportive of Russia and 2017 meetings with then-Syrian President Bashar Assad.

    "text": "“Daily Show” host Jon Stewart on Monday called out the growing number of Republican lawmakers who are threatening to block emergency aid to California unless they receive political concessions in return. Stewart rolled multiple clips of GOP figures saying they want “strings attached” to any federal aid for the Los Angeles area, which has been ravaged by a series of devastating fires. “They don’t deserve anything, to be honest with you, unless they show us they’re going to make some changes,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) told Newsmax in one clip. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” Stewart fired back, then railed against Tuberville: “Really, senator from Alabama? The state near the bottom in math, reading and test scores? Next time you get hit by a fucking hurricane, why don’t we have a little parent-teacher conference to see that if you got your scores up you would get the money. Or actually, let’s not do it because you’ll get the money anyway because we’re not fucking psychos. That is psychotic. There’s something wrong with you.” Stewart noted that some of the very same GOP lawmakers demanding conditions on aid to California had no problem asking for cash when their own states faced natural disasters.

    "title": "Josh Gad Has A Lot To Say About That ‘Gay Moment’ In ‘Beauty And The Beast’",
    "text": "Eight years after the release of Disney’s live-action adaptation of “Beauty and the Beast,” actor Josh Gad is reflecting on the controversy surrounding the film’s so-called “exclusively gay moment.” In his memoir “In Gad We Trust,” Gad brushes off the implication that the 2017 film was intended to feature Disney’s “first-ever gay character” despite a brief scene in which his character, LeFou, was seen dancing with another man. “I for one certainly didn’t exactly feel like LeFou was who the queer community had been wistfully waiting for,” the actor wrote, as seen in an excerpt of the book published by Entertainment Weekly. “I can’t quite imagine a Pride celebration in honor of the ‘cinematic watershed moment’ involving a quasi-villainous Disney sidekick dancing with a man for half a second. I mean, if I were gay, I’m sure I’d be pissed.” Gad also notes that he “never once discussed” LeFou’s sexuality with the movie’s creative team, and described the much-buzzed-about dancing scene as “harmless” and “a fun blink-and-you’ll-miss-it little beat.” “It was both too little and not enough to be anything more than it was,” he wrote. The discourse surrounding LeFou’s sexuality can be traced to director Bill Condon, who suggested in a 2017 interview that the character had more-than-platonic feelings for the film’s lead antagonist, Gaston (played by Luke Evans). “LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston. He’s confused about what he wants,” Condon told Attitude magazine at the time, before noting that the film concludes with “a nice, exclusively gay moment.” After news of the subplot made headlines, “Beauty and the Beast” was banned in several countries and drew boycotts in the U.S. Still, the film was a box office smash, raking in a reported $1.2 billion worldwide. Noting that Condon “felt awful” about his remarks, Gad believes LeFou’s flirtation with a male suitor might have been better received if viewers had been permitted to discover it for themselves. “Had the audience defined it as a sweet exclusively gay moment, I would have been delighted! But the second we pointed it out and seemingly congratulated ourselves, we had invited hell and fury,” he wrote. A Tony Award nominee for “The Book of Mormon,” Gad continues to have a professional relationship with Disney, having endeared himself to a generation of viewers as the voice of Olaf in the “Frozen” films. As for Disney’s depiction of the LGBTQ+ community in its films and television series, however, it has remained spotty in recent years. The company drew backlash in 2020 when it announced “Love, Victor,” a queer-inclusive teen series developed for Disney+, would instead debut on Hulu after producers reportedly concluded its subject matter wasn’t family-friendly. The show was later made available on both of the Disney-owned streaming platforms. In December, Disney confirmed that a storyline involving a transgender character had been removed from the forthcoming Pixar series “Win or Lose.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "DOJ Directs Prosecutors To Probe Local Efforts To Obstruct Immigration Enforcement",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is directing its federal prosecutors to investigate for potential criminal charges any state or local officials who stand in the way of beefed-up enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration, according to a memo to the workforce obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday. The memo, written by acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, also instructs the Justice Department’s civil division to work with a newly formed Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group to identify state and local laws and policies that “threaten to impede” the Trump administration’s immigration efforts and potentially challenge them in court. The three-page memo signals an immediate and sharp turnabout in priorities from President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration, with prosecutors told in no uncertain terms that they will be on the front lines of an administration-wide effort to crack down on illegal immigration and border crime and that they are expected to carry out the policy vision of President Donald Trump’s Republican White House when it comes to violent crimes, the threat of transnational gangs and drug trafficking. “Indeed, it is the responsibility of the Justice Department to defend the Constitution, and accordingly, to lawfully execute the policies that the American people elected President Trump to implement,” wrote Bove, who prior to joining the administration was part of the legal team that defended Trump against two criminal cases brought by the Justice Department. “The Justice Department’s responsibility, proudly shouldered by each of its employees, includes aggressive enforcement of laws enacted by Congress, as well as vigorous defense of the President’s actions on behalf of the United States against legal challenges,” Bove added. “The Department’s personnel must come together in the offices that taxpayers have funded to do this important work.” The memo said federal prosecutors must “take all steps necessary to protect the public and secure the American border by removing illegal aliens from the country and prosecuting illegal aliens for crimes” committed in U.S. jurisdiction.” The memo suggests there will be a spike in immigration cases under the new administration, instructing U.S. attorney’s offices across the country to inform courts of its policy “and develop processes for handling the increased number of prosecutions that will result.” Any decisions by federal prosecutors to decline to prosecute immigration violations must be disclosed to Justice Department headquarters in so-called “urgent reports,” which are used to update leadership on law enforcement emergencies or significant matters of national interest. It also directs prosecutors to investigate for potential criminal charges cases in which state and local officials obstruct or impede federal functions. As potential avenues for prosecution, the memo cites a conspiracy offense as well as a law prohibiting the harboring of people in the country illegally. “Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests,” the memo says. “The U.S. Attorney’s Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution. The Justice Department is also directing the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces to “assist in the execution of President Trump’s immigration-related initiatives,” though the memo did not elaborate on what that work might entail. It also ordered the department’s components, such as the FBI and the federal Bureau of Prisons, to hand over to the Department of Homeland Security any “identifying information” they might have about people believed to be in the country illegally “for the sole purpose of facilitating appropriate removals, enforcement actions, and immigration-related investigations and prosecutions.” The memo also says the department will return to the principle of charging defendants with the most serious crime it can prove, a staple position of Republican-led departments meant to remove a prosecutor’s discretion to charge a lower-level offense. And it rescinds policies implemented by Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland, including one designed to end sentencing disparities that have imposed harsher penalties for different forms of cocaine. “The most serious charges are those punishable by death where applicable, and offenses with the most significant mandatory minimum sentences,” Bove wrote.

The memo reflects the constant push-and-pull between Democratic and Republican administrations over how best to commit resources to what officials regard as the most urgent threat of the time. The edict to charge the most readily provable offense, for instance, is consistent with directives from prior Republican attorneys general including John Ashcroft and Jeff Sessions, while Democratic attorneys general including Eric Holder and Garland have replaced the policy and instead encouraged prosecutorial discretion.

    "title": "Kansas Health Officials Are Battling An ‘Unprecedented’ Tuberculosis Outbreak",
    "text": "Health officials in Kansas say they are battling an “unprecedented” tuberculosis outbreak that’s infected at least 146 people in the state’s northeast. As of Friday, there are 67 people currently being treated for active cases of the bacterial disease, commonly known as TB, in the Kansas City metro area, Jill Bronaugh, a spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment told HuffPost in an email Monday. Sixty of these active cases are in Wyandotte County, and the remaining seven are in Johnson County. An additional 79 inactive infections, where the person shows no symptoms, have been confirmed in the same areas, with 77 in Wyandotte County and two in Johnson County, Bronaugh said. “The current [metro-area] outbreak is the largest documented outbreak in U.S. history, presently,” she said. This record dates back to the 1950s when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started monitoring and reporting TB cases, she said. Bronaugh noted that there could be more cases not yet confirmed. Last year, KDHE reported 79 active and 213 latent cases in both counties from an outbreak and non-outbreak. There were also two reported TB deaths that were associated with this current outbreak, she said. Deputy Secretary For Public Health Ashley Goss updated the state’s Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee last week about the outbreak, which she called “unprecedented.” The CDC is “on the ground” in Kansas to offer the health department support with the outbreak, which the KDHE first became involved with last summer, she said. “We are trending in the right direction right now. More to come on that. Hopefully, we can get it wound down quickly,” she said Tuesday. Representatives with the CDC did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Monday. TB spreads from a bacterium ― or germ ― that is passed through the air when someone infected coughs, speaks or sings. The disease usually affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys or spine, according to the CDC. Not everyone infected becomes sick. Some people can be diagnosed with inactive cases of TB when they have smaller quantities of the bacterium in their body that are alive but latent. Though people with inactive cases don’t have symptoms and cannot spread the disease to others, they still need treatment to prevent the bacterium ― which can live in the body for years without causing symptoms ― from becoming active, the CDC says. Kansas’ health department said it is offering free TB treatment to those infected who are uninsured or if the treatment isn’t covered by their health insurance. The disease’s symptoms include a long-term cough, fever, chest pain, chills, coughing up blood or sputum, weakness or fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, and night sweats. TB is one of the world’s leading infectious disease killers, with untreated cases potentially resulting in death. Though a vaccine exists, it’s not generally administered in the U.S., which has one of the lowest TB incidence rates in the world, according to the CDC and World Health Organization. Outside of the U.S., low- and middle-income countries see 98% of all TB cases. The countries with the highest number of cases are India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Pakistan, according to the WHO.

Case counts increased among all age groups and among U.S.-born and non-U.S.–born persons during this time, though cases were still disproportionately higher among non-U.S.–born persons and persons from racial and ethnic minority groups. In offering potential reasons for the surge, U.S. health officials noted that cases had risen globally the year before and that resources usually given to TB programs in the U.S. had been “severely taxed” and diverted toward the COVID-19 response instead. “These factors, along with changes in migration volume probably contributed to the decrease in the number of cases observed in 2020, and to the subsequent rise in case counts and rates since 2020,” the CDC said.

    "text": "Karoline Leavitt, the new White House press secretary, on Tuesday, drew mockery for her breathless praise of Donald Trump on Fox News. Leavitt — no stranger to bombastically going to bat for the president — claimed of Trump’s second administration: “We have truth on our side at this White House.” “This man is already doing more in less than 24 hours than his predecessor did in four years,” Leavitt, the youngest ever press secretary, also declared. beyond parody Leavitt’s hyperbole came as she teased an imminent announcement from Trump on infrastructure. While Trump was pilloried during his first term for not delivering on his often-touted “Infrastructure Week,” on Tuesday he did actually announce that billions of dollars from the private sector will be invested in infrastructure to boost the use and development of artificial intelligence. Critics, though, likened Leavitt’s rhetoric on Trump to that which is parroted on foreign state media, particularly in North Korea. “Propaganda so blatant it would make the dictator of North Korea blush,” one commenter wrote. Another cackled at her talk about “truth.” Trump told more than 30,000 lies during his term, per The Washington Post. Just replace every interview with this. It's easier and saves time.

Klobuchar, the chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, rode with the two men from the White House to the U.S. Capitol for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony. In an interview with ABC News, Klobuchar recalled some of the topics that were discussed during the ride. “I’m not going to reveal every detail except to say maybe we did discuss football just a little bit and some of the games yesterday,” Klobuchar told ABC’s David Muir. “We also talked about the now-president’s upcoming trip to Los Angeles, and I talked to him privately about that with the Olympics coming, and how important that is, and of course, mentioned the firefighters in my speech.” Trump is planning to visit Los Angeles this week to survey the damage inflicted by wildfires that have killed at least 27 people and destroyed thousands of homes. While Trump did not offer the same courtesy to Biden on the day of his inauguration in January 2021, Biden and his wife, Jill, greeted his successor and now-first lady Melania Trump at the White House on Monday morning, and invited the couple in for a tea reception before departing for the ceremony. Klobuchar said Biden was “gracious,” adding that the two men and their staff recently worked together to help broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the war in Gaza. The senator also expressed hope that Democrats will be able to forge a working relationship with Trump despite existing tensions. “There’s going to be a lot of disagreements going forward but there has to be a way where we can cross the river of our divides and find some common ground when we can,” Klobuchar said.

    "title": "This 'Filler In A Bottle' Serum From Korea Is A Top Amazon Find",
    "text": "HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Korean beauty —or K-beauty, as it’s better known — has dominated much of the skin care world and community, especially on TikTok, where beauty obsessives regularly come together to surface and share some of the most trailblazing products. Ashley Mixon, a beauty TikToker who is a self-proclaimed K-beauty enthusiast with a devout following, previously made a TikTok video speaking about the Korean brand Iope. Giggly goirl skincare 💓✨🫧 #mixonmethod #kbeauty #edutainment #toners #newproducts #skincare According to her, Iope is allegedly also the brand behind famed “cushion foundations” and other innovative beauty goods. One product in particular that TikTok has gone crazy over is their Iope Bio-PDRN Caffeine Face Shot, a serum that Mixon calls “filler in a bottle,” a “hero product” and “lifting.” (Note: HuffPost reached out to Mixon and found she does receive compensation from Iope, but only from her affiliate link and not from the brand directly.) Mixon isn’t the only fan of the Bio-PDRN Caffeine Face Shot. Many reviewers claim this $50 serum has made their skin smoother, helped improve hormonal acne, reduced the appearance of fine lines and even become a replacement for Botox and prescription-strength retinoids like Tretinoin. (It should be noted, however, that dermatologists say no at-home treatment can ever be as effective as Botox.) Mixon and Iope attribute these kinds of alleged results to an ingredient called PDRN, an anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing proprietary drug that is normally injected in the hopes of improving the overall skin appearance and skin firmness of the recipient. Normally extracted from the sperm cells of salmon, Iope’s version of PDRN is developed from plants, so the formula is completely vegan. In addition to plant-powered PDRN, the serum also contains a more recognizable combination of ingredients like niacinamide — a versatile antioxidant that many swear by for everything from brightening skin to managing redness — and probiotics, an unlikely ingredient that dermatologists have previously told HuffPost can do wonders for keeping skin healthy and strong. And if you’re wondering what caffeine is doing in your skin care and not your latte, there is some evidence to support that, due to its antioxidant properties, topical applications of caffeine may aid in reducing the appearance of wrinkles caused by sun damage. “It contains 20,000 ppm (parts per million) of caffeine, which is one-eighteenth the size of collagen, so yes it does penetrate into the skin!” Mixon told HuffPost via email. The brand says that to use the serum, just apply three to four drops after your toner and before creams and moisturizers. Mixon said that it can be used day or night and doesn’t interfere with other products or other active ingredients that you might be using. Miraculously, you don’t have to travel to Korea to get yourself a bottle of the Bio-PDRN Caffeine Face Shot. You can head right to your trusty virtual shelves of Amazon (or any of the other above listed retailers) in order to see what all the hype is about for yourself. Or keep reading to see some more promising reviews. Promising Soko Glam reviews: “I just turned 41 and let me tell you! I haven’t had Botox in over 8 months because of this serum. I have slight fine lines in my forehead and have gotten Botox 4 times over the last two years to make them disappear. Usually after 4 months Botox starts wearing off but I’m on month 8 and have been using this serum for 6 months and fines lines are not appearing even slightly like they normally would. I’ve also started putting this on my nasal folds and under my eyes and crow feet area and my skin looks much more plumped as if I have collagen filling my face as I did in my late 20’s. I’m telling you this is IT! Even better than the hype Sephora brands and better than Sulwashoo.” — Brandi “Ashley [Mixon] recommended this on TikTok. I decided to try it, and I LOVE IT!! I will forever keep this in my skin care line up. I feel it’s helped my fine lines and wrinkles better than a full year of Tretinoin has! Amazing product!!” — Michelle “This was my first time purchasing this serum and it was worth every single penny. I turned 30 this year and I’ve been noticing some slight forehead wrinkles and other fine lines on my face. I started including retinol into my regimen but wasn’t seeing the results I wanted. I was at the point where I was considering Tretinoin (and even Botox!). So when I saw this, I was immediately intrigued. A retinol substitute? I read up on PDRN injections and saw how good the results were. This is a topical serum but I figured, why not? First night I used this there was a noticeable lift! A few days later, my forehead feels & looks soooo smooth. This is going to be a repeat product. Next time I’m going to buy the toner that goes with it!!!” — Malina “I apply this on my skin every morning and night. It really works and gave my skin a fresh look. Has really helped my skin lifted and hydrated so much! My skin is smoother and hormonal breakouts much decreased. Can’t wait to try more of their products!” — Jessica By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Kylie Jenner Can't Help But Giggle At Timothée Chalamet Dig During Golden Globes",
    "text": "Kylie Jenner had a good sense of humor while attending the Golden Globes with Timothée Chalamet on Sunday night. The reality star and makeup mogul couldn’t help but crack a smile after her actor boyfriend became the butt of the joke during host Nikki Glaser’s opening monologue. When Glaser called Chalamet’s wispy mustache “the most gorgeous eyelashes on your upper lip,” the star of “A Complete Unknown” buckled in half with laughter. Jenner had a more subtle reaction, as she stifled her giggles with a small smile and a sweep of her hair. Though the A-listers didn’t walk the red carpet together, it was clear the two were having a great time during the show while sitting with Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro, Chalamet’s co-stars from the Bob Dylan biopic. The Globes were one of Chalamet and Jenner’s rare public appearances together. Since the pair began dating two years ago, they have tried to keep their relationship as private as possible. The “Dune” actor was very coy about his love life while attending the Palm Springs International Film Festival on Friday, when he walked the red carpet solo but had Jenner join him inside the event.

    "title": "'Irony Is Dead': Lara Trump Slammed After Clueless Complaint About 'Competence'",
    "text": "Lara Trump on Thursday defended her father-in-law, President Donald Trump, for blaming this week’s deadly plane crash in Washington in part on diversity initiatives, and signing a memorandum to end DEI programs in aviation in response. But her critics are pointing out that she might not be the best person for the job of delivering that message. Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that her father-in-law’s memo says hirings should be based on “competence and merit and that’s it.” She said diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have “been a huge problem” and called them a “disservice to the public.” “We want the best people. We want the most competent people,” she said. “And we should never be hiring anyone for any job other than the best person for that job, that should be the No. 1 reason.” Lara Trump was a producer for “Inside Edition” before marrying Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons. She has since hosted a show for a Trump-run website, sang to decidedly mixed reviews, and ― most recently ― served as co-chair of the Republican National Committee. But her critics said it wasn’t “competence and merit” that got her that last gig, but her last name ― and were quick to point that out on X, formerly Twitter: Irony is dead part whatever. https://t.co/NirQhrm2O1 Did irony die, again? https://t.co/qE46vHBIog Finally. Someone standing up for those who got their jobs the real way, marrying the president’s son. https://t.co/FSOtvPceiT Someone ask Lara Trump why she has the job she has https://t.co/vza9n2XWJv Nepo hire says what? https://t.co/MhZ4UAztLS lara? what’s ur last name? https://t.co/jwhEGDCVbs This woman got her job by marrying Eric Trump. Eric. Trump. https://t.co/IC6ImdcP6F Who's gonna tell her? https://t.co/wxTNkgHaEr The irony of her saying this despite the only reason she’s even on television and in her position is due entirely to nepotism and was elevated to said station in a meritless manner.

(Watch the video below.) President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it doesn’t give Greenland to the U.S. could mean restricted access to the Danish medicine; ergo, the heftier price tag, The New York Times reported.

    "text": "Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert reportedly tried to kick a “guy” out of a women’s restroom in the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, only to realize she’d made a mistake. Congressional leaders were voting on the House floor when the far-right representative reportedly came “bursting” out of a nearby women’s restroom and complained to security that there was “a guy” inside, Bloomberg reporter Billy House wrote in a series of posts on X. Transgender people are banned from using single-sex facilities that align with their gender identities near the House Chamber under a policy first introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.). House said Boebert brought Mace over to help sniff out the supposed intruder. Recalling the scene, House said he waited outside the restroom after seeing Boebert and Mace storm back in. He saw four people leave after her, all women. Back on the House floor, Boebert falsely told colleagues that the person she saw was Rep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.), the Daily Beast reported, citing sources present. McBride, who was not in the restroom, is the first transgender member of Congress and the target of Mace’s bathroom ban. “You shouldn’t be here,” Boebert said she told the person in the women’s room, according to the Daily Beast. After reporting the incident to colleagues, House said Boebert returned to the restroom with Mace. Both entered the room but “just seconds” later, they “quietly” exited and returned to the House floor, he wrote. House said he questioned Boebert about what happened and said she admitted that she hadn’t seen “a guy” after all. “I apologized, learned a lesson, and it won’t happen again,” she said in a statement to the Daily Beast. A spokesperson for McBride chastised the two lawmakers for their behavior. “What a thoroughly predictable ― and predicted ― outcome,” Michaela Kurinsky-Malos told HuffPost on Friday. “Rep. McBride thinks people should get back to work rather than play bathroom police.” Representatives for Boebert and Mace did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment Friday.

    "title": "Left-Wing Protesters Disrupt DNC Candidate Forum, Exposing Ideological Fault Lines",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — A stream of left-wing protesters interrupted the Democratic National Committee’s final chair candidate forum on Thursday night, shouting slogans about climate change and billionaire influence before being escorted out of a Georgetown University theater. The spaced-out nature and scale of the disruptions — one after another, after another — immobilized the forum for a period, as one of the televised event’s three MSNBC moderators, Symone Sanders, strained to re-assert control and campus police and security guards hauled people out. In a leadership contest that has been largely void of explicit ideological debate, the chaotic interruption felt like a metaphor for a party that can’t permanently ignore its internal policy debates and activist passions. When asked afterward about the disruptions, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, currently running for DNC chair in a competitive third-place position behind Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, and Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, treated it like a healthy component of the Democratic Party’s process. “I’m surprised I haven’t seen more of it,” O’Malley said in a press gaggle. “They’re going to be on this planet a lot longer than I am, and if they stop caring passionately about the planet, then we have no hope at all. So it didn’t bother me.” The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led, left-wing climate action group, said the first three protesters, who, about 20 minutes into the forum, began separately standing up to shout slogans while candidates or moderators were speaking, were affiliated with their group. The activists sought to draw attention to the Sunrise Movement’s pledge, calling on DNC chair candidates to revive the Obama-era ban on corporate PAC and lobbyist donations to the DNC and use “every tool” at their disposal to discourage super PAC spending in Democratic primaries. “We need the Democratic Party to loudly and proudly stand up against billionaires and show young voters that Democrats are the only party ready to fight for working people,” Adah, the 18-year-old Sunrise activist who made the first interruption, said in a statement issued by Sunrise. “If you don’t, young voters and working-class voters will continue to leave the party — you will let Trump and people like him keep convincing people that he will fight for them.” Jason Paul, an attorney, and self-help author Marianne Williamson, two of the more marginal DNC chair contenders, were the only candidates onstage who had already signed on to the Sunrise Movement’s pledge. That was cause for Paul to express frustration with Sunrise. “I think it’s a little odd when people onstage agree with you, that you then yell at them,” he said, prompting applause from the audience. After the Sunrise protesters left, a series of other, apparently more hard-line, left-wing climate activists rose one after the other to lament billionaire influence on the DNC and how it could jeopardize the fight against climate change. “What will you do to get fossil fuel money out of Democratic politics? We are facing a climate emergency!” a young man yelled, his voice quavering, as he was dragged out of the theater. Several of the demonstrators physically refused to cooperate with the campus police officers, leading to loud and violent confrontations as they were sometimes carried out by multiple people at a time. pic.twitter.com/UmW41uSaqk Forum attendees, largely made up of voting DNC members, grew frustrated with the number of disruptions. “Protest the Republicans! Protest the people who are actually hurting you!” one called out. Sanders, who co-moderated the event alongside MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart and Jen Psaki, tried to maintain calm as the last demonstrators were being removed. “I think it’s important to say here, we respect people’s opinions,” she said. “And it is definitely understandable that there is a lot of passion in this moment.” One man with his hair in a bun, who had been filming many of the protesters’ interactions with security professionals, turned to the entire theater and yelled, “Peace out, bitches,” before finally exiting. Once the theater calmed down, Psaki decided to give Sunrise its due and ask if every DNC chair candidate present would commit to swearing off corporate PAC donations if they were elected chair. Every candidate raised their hand except for Martin and Wikler, who each spoke about the need to raise enough money to win power so that Democrats could eventually nominate enough Supreme Court justices to overturn the 2010 Citizens United ruling permitting corporations to spend unlimited sums on elections. “I will work my ass off to make sure we push against the corrosive impact of money out of politics,” Martin said, adding that he would not accept contributions from corporations involved in union busting. Martin and Wikler went on to join the other chair candidates in pledging not to accept donations from oil and gas companies’ corporate PACs. Sunrise celebrated the candidates’ pledge in a post on social media. But it’s not clear exactly what kind of impact the pledge will have at a time when fossil fuel companies don’t seem too keen to contribute to Democrats anyway. Oil and gas industry PACs contributed $10.2 million to Republican congressional candidates last election cycle, compared with just under $1.8 million to Democratic congressional candidates. And the Democratic National Committee got just $11.6 million of its $1.9 billion haul in 2024 from employees of energy and natural resource companies. Democrats looking for the party’s future chair to adopt the Sunrise Movement’s platform wholesale might have come away from the evening disappointed, but so would the perhaps even greater number of mainstream Democrats eager to see party leaders defy left-wing activist groups that critics see as out of touch with the median voter. Faiz Shakir, a former manager of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, who’s running on an economic populist platform, was the only candidate onstage willing to flatly say “no” to two culturally progressive demands pushed by DNC members in the audience.

Asked whether the candidates would support increasing the number of at-large seats reserved for transgender people — currently just one — and later whether the DNC should create a Muslim council or caucus, Shakir was the only contender to refuse. He affirmed his commitment to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” while insisting on an approach that unites people with divergent backgrounds behind common goals. “I am frustrated by the way in which we utilize identity to break ourselves apart,” said Shakir, who would be the DNC’s first Muslim chair. “I would like to see us focus on program and mission in which you bring your identity to programs that we would like to do at the DNC.” “I want to build people who see the program mission, and then regardless of what background you might come from, I hope the first priority is building that economic justice vision that is inclusive,” he added.

    "text": "Bruce David Klein had completed just one day of shooting on his new documentary, “Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story,” when he had an “unnerving” encounter with the film’s subject, Liza Minnelli. “She called me into her bedroom, where she’s sitting on the edge of her bed, and she grabs my hand and starts petting it,” the filmmaker recalled to HuffPost. “And she looks up at me and says: ‘Bruce, don’t make me look like a phony.’” “I know Liza fans will love anything she does, every statement she makes, every joke she cracks,” he continued. “[But] everybody, whether they’re celebrities or not, wants to control what they look like, control the narrative. So for her ― with her legendary, iconic status ― to say something like that was unbelievable.” Klein’s unfettered access to Minnelli pays off in the documentary, which premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival and opened in New York last week ahead of a Los Angeles debut Friday and a nationwide release next month. The film is, by all accounts, a heartfelt testament to the actor and singer’s era-defining career. Even for seasoned fans, “Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story” is a treat, featuring never-before-seen footage of Minnelli in her heyday along with anecdotes from collaborators and friends like Joel Grey, Mia Farrow and the late Chita Rivera. Then, of course, there’s Minnelli herself. The 78-year-old is as jovial and quick-witted as ever in interviews with Klein, even showing off her still-supple singing voice in a handful of scenes. As the documentary notes, the daughter of Hollywood icon Judy Garland and Oscar-winning director Vincente Minnelli seemed poised for superstardom at birth. She made her big-screen debut as a toddler, appearing alongside her mother in 1949’s “In the Good Old Summertime,” but would face challenges in being taken seriously as a performer as she matured. The film hits a somber note with Garland’s 1969 death of a drug overdose at age 47, after which a grieving Minnelli is driven to create an artistic persona that exists independently of her mother. From there, the film zooms in on Minnelli’s many triumphs. Having nabbed the first of four Tony Awards in 1965 for “Flora the Red Menace,” her career kicked into overdrive when she portrayed Sally Bowles in the 1972 movie musical “Cabaret,” winning an Oscar. In the years that followed, she added an Emmy and a Grammy to her professional tally and performed to sold-out audiences around the world, but like Garland, had a tumultuous love life and experienced drug and alcohol addiction behind the scenes. “She was the ‘It Girl’ of the world ― people today don’t understand what it means to have been on the cover of Time and Newsweek in the same week,” Klein said. As for the segments that touch on Minnelli’s substance abuse, four marriages and, most poignantly, her unfulfilled desire to become a mother, he added: “We realized how important they were for her journey.” The documentary also showcases five show business figures ― singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour, lyricist Fred Ebb, director-choreographer Bob Fosse, designer Halston and music arranger and performer Kay Thompson ― who served as Minnelli’s mentors and honed her talents. “I defy anyone to watch anything from Liza and say, ‘Oh, she’s only there as a ‘nepo baby.’ One of the biggest discoveries was how much of a double-edged sword that privilege was for her,” Klein said. “There’s an unintentional message in the film that I’m happy came out, which is about the power mentors have to transform us if we let them.” Minnelli has maintained a lower profile in recent years, but her influence on pop culture is still evident, with stars like Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande similarly melding the avant-garde with old-fashioned razzle-dazzle. A revival of “Cabaret” opened on Broadway last spring after a successful run in London, starring “GLOW” actor Gayle Rankin as Sally Bowles. Still, Klein is confident that “there will never be another Liza.” “Maybe Taylor Swift has a little edge of vulnerability and awkwardness sometimes, but there’s no one I can say who is even in the Liza realm,” he said. “This concoction of extreme power, strength and talent, along with unbelievable vulnerability, nervousness and fear wrapped into one package ... I don’t know if a publicist today would allow a star of her level to show all that.” Watch the trailer for “Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story” below.

    "title": "California Governor Says Pacific Palisades Wildfire Has Destroyed Many Structures As Winds Kick Up",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A wildfire whipped up by extreme winds swept through a Los Angeles hillside dotted with celebrity residences Tuesday, burning homes in Pacific Palisades and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands. In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways were clogged and scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases. The traffic jam on Palisades Drive prevented emergency vehicles from getting through and a bulldozer was brought in to push the abandoned cars to the side and create a path, according to the LA Fire Department. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in Southern California to attend the naming of a national monument by President Joe Biden, made a detour to the canyon to see “firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers,” and he said he found “not a few — many structures already destroyed.” Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under threat. And the worst could be yet to come. The blaze began around 10:30 a.m., shortly after the start of a Santa Ana windstorm that the National Weather service warned could be “life threatening” and the strongest to hit Southern California in more than a decade. The exact cause of the fire was unknown and no injuries had been reported, officials said. Only about 25 miles (about 40 kilometers) northeast in Altadena, another fire spread to more than 200 acres (81 hectares) by Tuesday evening, prompting evacuation orders, the Angeles National Forest posted on the social platform X. The winds were expected to increase overnight and continue for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 100 mph (160 kph) in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven’t seen substantial rain in months. “By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,” Newsom warned residents, saying the worst of the winds are expected between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. He declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. LAFD: Evacuate now from the area of Palisades Area. Those not in the evacuation area should shelter in place. Evacuation order for Palisades Fire. Maps and information can be found at https://t.co/GihYtg2yPf https://t.co/kMAzuc7uaf As of Tuesday evening, 28,300 households were without power due to the strong winds, according to the mayor’s office. About 15,000 utility customers in Southern California had their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking a blaze. A half a million customers total were at risk of losing power preemptively. The Pacific Palisades fire quickly consumed about 4.6 square miles (11.6 square kilometers) of land in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. “We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,” Trainor said. “People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour.” An Associated Press video journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. An AP photographer saw multi-million dollar mansions on fire as helicopters overhead dropped water loads. Roads were clogged in both directions as evacuees fled down toward the Pacific Coast Highway while others begged for rides back up to their homes to rescue pets. Two of the homes on fire were inside exclusive gated communities. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife’s car as she tried to evacuate. “She vacated her car and left it running,” Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe. Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years he’s lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs “like small explosions,” which he said he believes were the transformers exploding. “It is crazy, it’s everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home’s safe, the other one’s up in flames,” Adams said. The #windstorm in Southern CA is expected to blow through Wednesday. Wind gusts can reach up to 100 mph, please stay safe indoors. pic.twitter.com/Rjea1ceaaA Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. “Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,” Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. “This is not a parking lot,” Guttenberg told KTLA. “I have friends up there and they can’t evacuate. … I’m walking up there as far as I can moving cars.” The erratic weather caused Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost. Biden said in a statement that he and his team are communicating with state and local officials and he has offered “any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire.” Some trees and vegetation on the grounds of the Getty Villa were burned by late Tuesday, but staff and the museum collection remain safe, Getty President Katherine Fleming said in a statement. The museum located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades area. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there’s been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn’t seen more than 0.1 inches (0.25 centimeters) of rain since early May. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Maggie Haberman Boils Down Donald Trump’s Latest ‘Troll’ To 1 Thing",
    "text": "The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman on Tuesday suggested President-elect Donald Trump is “clearly in an expansionist mindset” with his recent talk about buying Greenland, merging the United States with Canada, and taking over the Panama Canal. But Haberman sought to differentiate the three ideas and explain how “these things are not all the same.” “Panama is a relatively new focus of his,” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, also noting how the idea of America “acquiring Greenland for strategic purposes” has been floated for decades. Trump’s chatter about Canada becoming the 51st state, though, is “clearly much more of a troll,” said Haberman. It’s also “sort of a dominance play,” she added. Trump earlier Tuesday refused to rule out using military action to seize control of the Panama Canal and Greenland. Haberman wasn’t sure if Trump was actually thinking about using force or if it was just because he was angry about his upcoming sentencing in his hush money trial and the possible public release of special counsel Jack Smith’s reports on his classified documents and Jan. 6 election subversion cases. Cooper asked if it actually could all just be a ploy by Trump to distract Americans if he fails to completely fulfill some of his more extreme campaign promises, such as conducting the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, when he returns to the White House in less than two weeks. Haberman doubted it was a technique of willful distraction. Instead, she put it down to Trump’s tactic of flooding the information zone to overwhelm the media and critics.

    "title": "Many LGBTQ+ Americans Are Planning To Leave The Country. What Will Happen If I Stay?",
    "text": "When I was four years old, my dad’s job transferred him north, so he and my mom moved our family to Canada for six years. While living there, they decided that we should all become Canadian citizens. I don’t know what compelled my parents to go through the process of gaining citizenship for all of us in a country we didn’t plan to live in very long, but I’m glad they did. Through the years, it’s always felt like a safety net for me, especially as anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment here in the United States has increased. Last summer, as the presidential election loomed, my wife and I talked frequently about what it would look like if we decided to take our two kids and leave the country. We understood, and still do, that we’re “protected” here in New York, but when you’re an LGBTQ+ family, it doesn’t matter where you live, or how safe you feel: You must always have a plan. After Nov. 5, my plan was to cry. All the time. But I had to make dinner for my kids and do the laundry. I also had a deadline for an article I was writing, and I needed to get in touch with my sources. I have a professional acquaintance in the Midwest who, like me, is queer, married, and raising two kids. I had an unusually difficult time getting her on the phone for our early November interview. “I know this is a challenging time,” I texted, “just let me know when you’re free.” When I finally did get to speak with her, she confessed why she’d been so busy. It wasn’t simply the exhausting aftermath of an election that devastated much of the queer community; she and her trans husband were moving their family abroad. I was impressed. I don’t know a single person in my queer community who hadn’t considered their own exit strategy in the wake of a Trump administration. I also didn’t know anyone who was actually going through with it. Gina, who requested to withhold her last name for her family’s safety, told me, “I don’t want to live here feeling angry and hurt. It’s not good for my mental well-being, feeling betrayed by people everywhere I go.” Gina and her husband put their house on the market immediately following the election, and it sold right away. Then, they had to face the harsh logistics of moving their family abroad. She told me that the planning was difficult, but that staying would be worse. “It’s hard just to be in public. I look around and I think, half of the people in this room voted to hurt us, and did that because they are either ignorant, or they hate us,” she said. Leaving the place they call home is emotional for Gina and her family, but she wants to keep them safe. “If we live somewhere where our rights are protected at a federal level, that might feel like a relief,” she added. Gina introduced me to Jess Drucker, founder of Rainbow Relocation, a nationwide organization founded to “empower queer folks and their families to move, live, and thrive aboard.” Drucker told me that previously, she worked with individuals and families who were looking for an adventure abroad. In November, she was inundated with requests for help. “The increase is definitely threat-based and fear-based,” she said. Drucker is also working more than ever with trans people, she told me. “That’s the group that feels the most under threat and has the most rush on their paperwork for gender markers, gender identity and passports. That’s much more complex,” she said. I inquired about which countries people were looking into, and Drucker confessed, “I’m a bit of a dream-killer.” “People are looking at the world as a buffet of country options,” she told me, but what they actually need to consider is their own value. If you’re wealthy, you might consider a European Golden Visa, which offers foreign investors a temporary residence permit if they maintain an investment – usually real estate – within the country. Some nations offer temporary residence to highly skilled migrants, which are foreigners with advanced degrees or specialized professions who will bring their skills to the nation’s workforce. “If you don’t offer professional value, you can still offer something to economically insecure countries,” Drucker explained. There are volunteer opportunities in countries that are queer and trans friendly, like Nicaragua or Bolivia. She was also clear that it is extremely difficult for LGBTQ+ Americans to seek asylum. “Going [abroad] and hoping to get asylum status comes at great financial peril should that claim get rejected and you have to move back to the US,” she said. “If you are going to move your life — a costly endeavor, of course — you might as well become as informed as possible how to do that with intention, on visas that you can qualify for, in countries that are safe.” Mike Garda, a New York-based therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, told me that initially, he had many conversations with his patients about moving. “I’ve observed a pretty steep decline in discussions about leaving the country, as folks have had more time to process, receive community care, and at times confront the reality of how difficult it would be to move abroad,” he said. Once the initial shock had worn off, Garda was able to shift conversations to what was within his clients’ control. “I helped many of my clients identify things they felt were possible to complete promptly and preemptively, such as name changes, gender marker designations and renewing passports,” he said. “I don’t think these conversations are over, and I expect that as we see new legislation roll out, folks will continue to mourn and look for a way to escape the pain of being marginalized and systematically oppressed.” Even Garda admitted that he had considered leaving, but ultimately he didn’t feel it would be right. “I think it would be incredibly privileged to move to Europe and continue to work virtually with clients who are unable to exert the same mobility. I think this is a time for queer resistance whether that is through activism, coalition-building [or] simply existing as we are,” he said. For many in the queer community, we will simply have to wait and see what happens. “I would love to be wrong,” Gina told me. “I would love to end up looking foolish for going abroad with our children for a couple of months or years. Wouldn’t that be the best-case scenario?” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

For people who can’t afford her fees, her Facebook group Queer Expats is a great place to connect and find helpful resources. The group’s membership grew by the thousands in the days following the election. “If a whole community is feeling scared, then we need to take it pretty seriously,” she said. For now, my family is staying put and turning to our community for strength. I can’t imagine leaving my loved ones, even as I mourn the future that I wanted for my children and the rights we stand to lose. Every LGBTQ+ American is faced with a choice right now about how to stay safe, how to move forward and how best to embody our own queer resistance. It’s okay if that resistance looks like a relocation abroad, engaging in activism or just simply existing as usual and living our everyday lives. My dual citizenship is a safety net I feel lucky to have, but my hope is that — for now — I won’t have to use it.

    "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) got hit with a wave of taunts Monday in another effort to legitimize the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America.” She posted a map of the gulf with a handwritten cutout of “America” affixed over “Mexico” on X. “This is what homeschooling looks like in GA-14!!” Greene enthused, referring to her district. “Gulf of America!!” This is what homeschooling looks like in GA-14!! ❤️Gulf of AMERICA!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/iYsmkqFILW Greene got engulfed by snark. One X user imagined MTG’s rationale: “Look at this distraction from food and gas prices that we claimed we could instantaneously lower.” Another showed the lawmaker a map that renamed it the “Gulf of a Felon.” Since President Donald Trump issued the executive order on Inauguration Day to rechristen the Gulf of Mexico, Greene has expected the world to obey Trump’s edict. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did. Britain didn’t. But Greene, who has already proposed legislation to solidify the renaming and get federal funding for changes on maps, is still doing her part one post at a time even if the body of water has been called the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years.

    "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Verbal Spin On Donald Trump Leaves Critics Dizzy",
    "text": "Conspiracy theory-peddling Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on Wednesday raised eyebrows with her attempted spin on Donald Trump’s reported walking back of one of his campaign vows. The president-elect had promised to immediately “fix” and settle the Russia-Ukraine war (which Russia began with its invasion in February 2022) on his return to the White House. “I would fix that within 24 hours, and if I win, before I get into the office, I will have that war settled,” Trump at one point even boasted to Fox News’ Sean Hannity. But, this week, days before Trump’s return to the Oval Office, his advisers admitted it would take months to stop the fighting because the situation was more complex than Trump had talked about on the trail. Greene defended the walk-back by claiming Trump hadn’t actually promised what he had actually promised. “I think you need to understand language,” Greene told the nonprofit news organization NOTUS. “And everyone else in America understands that language.” “I don’t think the media pressing Day One is specifically ‘Day One,’” Greene continued. “But he’s talking about that as one of his first roles as president, and there are many. He’s going to be writing hundreds of executive orders but, yes, ending that war is important.” Trump will “be the one that ends that war,” she added. Marjorie Taylor Greene said that people who took Trump at his word that he would end the Ukraine war on day one need to understand language. She then said that Trump lives in a peach tree dish under constant scrutiny in a peach tree dish. Mar Jar Binks Greene tries to explain Newspeak. She said \"Understand Language\" when she meant to not take things literally. Day One is not really Day One and 24 hours in not even 24 months if Big Brother says it.Newspeak is here. “I think you need to understand language,” Greene said, \"and everyone else in America understands that language.”That is what crazy lady marge said when asked about this.I say no marge, the American people understand that your orange Jesus is a lying idiot!!!!!!!!!!

    "title": "Mary Trump Exposes The ‘Sordid’ Truth About Uncle's Leadership In Disasters",
    "text": "Mary Trump on Sunday fiercely condemned her uncle Donald Trump’s politicization of the California wildfires, saying “one of the most frustrating things” about the president-elect’s conduct is that “none of it is surprising.” Trump has lobbed insults at and spread falsehoods about President Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) as the blazes have raged. As of Monday morning, the death toll stood at 24. A significant number of schools, homes and businesses have been burned to the ground. “Donald is no longer an unknown quantity,” the clinical psychologist wrote of her relative, of whom she has been a yearslong critic, in the latest edition of her email newsletter, “The Good In Us.” “After four years of his first administration, we are all too familiar with the sort of chaos he brings to already fraught situations,” Mary Trump continued. “He has, in fact, a long, sordid history of making things worse,” she added, before noting how her uncle had “demonstrated his unique combination of ignorance, indifference, and cruelty” during multiple natural disasters in his presidency and after being voted out of office in 2020. Mary Trump later explained her uncle’s playbook: “What we can expect, because we’ve seen time and time again: If you need help in a crisis, but you do not kiss Donald’s ass sufficiently, he will not help you. He will use the crisis to perpetuate misinformation and conspiracy theories which will lead to a greater loss of life. He will blame the victims. He will divide us against each other.” It echoed comments from Nicole Hemmer — an expert on conservative and right-wing media and an associate professor of history at Vanderbilt University ― who last week explained how Trump “takes these moments that used to be a time when people began to come together a little bit, at least in that period of immediate disaster when there’s shock and horror” and seeks to make political capital.

    "title": "McDonald's Is The Latest Company To Roll Back Diversity Goals",
    "text": "Four years after launching a push for more diversity in its ranks, McDonald’s is ending some of its diversity practices, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions. McDonald’s is the latest big company to shift its tactics in the wake of the 2023 ruling and a conservative backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Walmart, John Deere, Harley-Davidson and others rolled back their DEI initiatives last year. McDonald’s said Monday it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks. McDonald’s said it will also pause “external surveys.” The burger giant didn’t elaborate, but several other companies, including Lowe’s and Ford Motor Co., suspended their participation in an annual survey by the Human Rights Campaign that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees. McDonald’s, which has its headquarters in Chicago, rolled out a series of diversity initiatives in 2021 after a spate of sexual harassment lawsuits filed by employees and a lawsuit alleging discrimination brought by a group of Black former McDonald’s franchise owners. “As a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making,” McDonald’s Chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post at the time. But McDonald’s said Monday that the “shifting legal landscape” after the Supreme Court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to take a hard look at its own policies. A shifting political landscape may also have played a role. President-elect Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump tapped Stephen Miller, a former adviser who leads a group called America First Legal that has aggressively challenged corporate DEI policies,as his incoming deputy chief of policy. Vice President-elect JD Vance introduced a bill in the Senate last summer to end such programs in the federal government. Robby Starbuck, a conservative political commentator who has threatened consumer boycotts of prominent consumer brands that don’t retreat from their diversity programs, said Monday on X that he recently told McDonald’s he would be doing a story on its “woke policies.” McDonald’s said it had been considering updates to its policies for several months and planned to time the announcement to the start of this year. In an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald’s senior leadership team said it remains committed to inclusion and believes a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. The company said 30% of its U.S. leaders are members of underrepresented groups, up from 29% in 2021. McDonald’s previously committed to reaching 35% by the end of this year. McDonald’s said it has achieved one of the goals it announced in 2021: gender pay equity at all levels of the company. It also said it met three years early a goal of having 25% of total supplier spending go to diverse-owned businesses.

    "title": "Meghan Markle And Prince Harry Call Out Meta's Fact-Checking Policy",
    "text": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry said that Meta’s new fact-checking policy should “deeply concern us all.” “It doesn’t matter whether your views are left, right or somewhere in between — the latest news from Meta about changes to their policies directly undermines free speech,” the former royal couple said in a statement on their website. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced Meta would get rid of its fact-checking program because it was “too politically biased.” Instead, the company would implement a community notes feature, similar to the one on X, formerly Twitter, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk. Community notes relies on users to add notes or corrections to posts. Meta will also “remove restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are out of touch with mainstream discourse.” Users are now allowed to call women “household objects” and refer to transgender people as “it.” Markle and Prince Harry said these new guidelines allow “more abuse” and it normalizes “hate speech.” “In an already confusing and, in many instances, intentionally disruptive information environment, Meta has shown their words and commitments have very little meaning or integrity,” the couple said in a statement. “As they announce these changes undoubtedly responding to political winds, they once again abandon public safety in favor of profit, chaos, and control. The company’s decision to rollback protections is so far away from its stated values and commitments to its users — including the parents and families calling for change around the globe — that it’s now deeply deceptive.” In Zuckerberg’s announcement of the policy changes, he said the movement to be “more inclusive” has “gone too far.” “After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote non-stop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy,” Zuckerberg said. “We tried, in good faith, to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.” Following the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Meta banned Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram, after the former president used social media to incite violence, but recently, Zuckerberg has tried to get back in the president-elect’s good graces. Zuckerberg met with Trump in Florida and Meta donated $1 million to his inauguration fund. Markle and Prince Harry said they “urge Meta to reconsider and reinstate policies to protect all users,” as well as called on industry leaders “to uphold their commitments to integrity and public safety in online spaces, and we applaud leaders who refuse to kowtow to bullying.” “Millions of people are using Meta’s platforms in the United States. Hundreds of millions more are using them globally,” the couple’s statement reads. “Many use the platform to spread joy, build community, and share empowering information. Unfortunately, Meta’s recent decisions go directly against its stated mission to ‘build human connection’ and instead prioritize those using the platforms to spread hate, lies and division at the expense of everyone else.” They continued, saying Meta’s plan to give up its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs will “knowingly” put people in “harm’s way” and contribute to a “global mental health crisis.” “Given the profound global impact Meta’s decisions have on the world — of which many are still recovering from or actively suffering from — the politics of one country should never determine whether freedom of expression and civil and human rights are protected in the online spaces so clearly shaping or destroying democracy,” the statement reads.

    "text": "Actor and director Mel Gibson lost his Malibu home to the ongoing wildfires in Southern California while recording an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” in Austin, Texas, he told NewsNation on Thursday. “Obviously, it’s kind of devastating. It’s emotional,” he told the outlet. “You live there for a long time and you had all your stuff — you remember George Carlin talking about ‘your stuff’?” Gibson, who was referencing a well-known routine by the legendary comedian, said the flames took some “pretty cool stuff” from him, like photos, files and clothing. Still, he laughed while discussing the loss of his possessions. “I’ve been relieved from the burden of my stuff because it’s all in cinders,” said the Oscar-winning filmmaker behind 1995′s “Braveheart.” Gibson had sat down with podcaster Joe Rogan this week to discuss his Catholic faith and an upcoming movie called “Flight Risk.” “I was kind of ill at ease while we were talking because I knew my neighborhood was on fire,” Gibson said. “So I thought, ‘I wonder if my place is still there.’ But when I got home, sure enough, it wasn’t there.” He told NewsNation that his property “looked like Dresden” after Allied bombing of the German city in World War II, joking that “at least I haven’t got any of those pesky plumbing problems anymore.” Gibson — who previously fell from grace over reports of antisemitic remarks and other controversies, but has since received the support of fellow actors such as Andrew Garfield and Robert Downey Jr. — is one of multiple celebrities who have lost their homes and possessions to the California wildfires. Echoing remarks made by “This Is Us” star Milo Ventimiglia on Thursday, Gibson told NewsNation he hasn’t lost what truly matters.

    "title": "Mel Gibson On Trump's Visit To California: 'Daddy Arrived And He’s Taking His Belt Off'",
    "text": "Actor Mel Gibson offered a bizarre quote Friday while he appeared on Fox News to praise President Donald Trump’s recent visit to California amid the wildfires that have hit the state. While speaking with Sean Hannity on his “Hannity” show, Gibson said, “I’m glad Trump’s here at the moment. It’s like daddy arrived and he’s taking his belt off, you know?” “So, I think he’ll get some results here quickly,” he added. The actor’s home in Malibu was one of many destroyed by the wildfires. During his “Hannity” appearance, he sympathized with other people who’ve lost their homes. “And my heart goes out to all the other residents. You meet people all the time who’ve lost their homes,” he said. “And you talk and commiserate and buck each other up, and everyone’s putting on a brave face. They’re a good bunch out here.” Trump visited California on Friday, where he was met by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.). The president has threatened to withhold disaster relief aid from California to force policy changes in the state. Mel Gibson: I’m glad Trump is here. It’s like daddy arrived and he’s taking his belt off Gibson’s quote comes after Trump named him, as well as actors Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone, as “Special Ambassadors” to the “great but very troubled” Hollywood in a Jan. 16 post on Truth Social. In it, he said the actors will be his “eyes and ears,” and “I will get done what they suggest.” “It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood,” Trump wrote. The appointment came as a shock to Gibson, who told Variety that he learned of it through Trump’s Truth Social post and was “just as surprised.” “Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can,” he told the outlet. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Meta Will Give Trump $25 Million After He Was Banned From Platforms",
    "text": "Meta will pay President Donald Trump $25 million to settle a lawsuit after the tech giant banned him from Facebook and Instagram following the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news. The payment will include $22 million toward a fund for Trump’s presidential library, while the remaining $3 million will go to legal fees and several other plaintiffs who were also part of the case. The Journal notes Meta will not admit wrongdoing as part of the deal. Trump first sued Meta in 2021 after the social giant banned him, saying at the time he had violated its rules against inciting violence. His accounts were suspended for about two years, but were reinstated in January 2023 with what were meant to be “new guardrails in place.” Zuckerberg has made major overtures to the Trump administration since the November election. The Journal notes the pair began discussing a way to end the suit in November after Zuckerberg flew to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club for dinner following his electoral victory. Trump reportedly told the Facebook co-founder the case needed to be handled before he could be “brought into the tent,” a source told the paper. Meta has since moved to overhaul the way it does business. The company said it would end its fact-checking program in early January, saying the system was “too politically biased.” A week later, the company dropped programs aimed at boosting diversity within Meta, echoing Trump’s own attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. “A lot of the corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,” Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan after the move. The billionaire went on to praise “masculine” corporate energy and said he felt he now had “much greater command” over Meta’s policies.

Commenters pointed out how the certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over then-President Trump was only delayed (for hours) after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in their failed bid to overturn the result. Well, I guess it would be since there wasn't a mob of MAGAs rioting there. Funny how quickly things work when there is not a riot. Well, when you don’t have to fend off a few thousand insurrectionists, it tends to move pretty quick Uh yeah, it’s amazing how well it goes when you don’t try to overthrow the government.

Today, it’s $40.99 with a 23% off sale and an extra $5 coupon. One reviewer calls it their “stairway to fitness heaven,” noting that it’s a surprisingly intense workout: “After just a few minutes, my legs were burning like I had climbed Mount Everest. But the best part? I didn’t even have to leave my house or put on real pants. Take that, gym membership!” While walking pads have boomed in popularity, this small stair stepper helps you achieve the same thing but goes a little further: It has an LCD screen that displays calories burned, step count, time elapsed and more. The stair stepper is also only 16 inches tall at its maximum height and comes with two resistance bands that latch onto its base for additional full-body conditioning. It can hold up to 300 pounds, with adjustable foot pedals that can hold up to a men’s shoe size 12. The brand also describes it as a particularly quiet machine, so it won’t disrupt others around you while you step. Several users say this mini stepper is easy to use, has plenty of adjustable resistance, and they love that it comes preassembled. “This stepper is amazing,” wrote one customer. “I work out regularly, but this thing gives me a WORKOUT and quick! After just one week of regular stepping (about 15 minutes a day), I received three out-of-the-blue compliments on how my legs looked toned and fit. They asked what I was doing, and my response was: ‘mini stepper’!” “I bought the Niceday Steppers hoping for a simple way to get some exercise at home. Little did I know, I was about to embark on a journey to fitness heaven! First of all, let’s talk about the setup. It was so easy, I think even my cat could have put it together if she wasn’t too busy judging my life choices. The steppers were up and running (or should I say stepping?) in no time. Using the Niceday Steppers is like having your own personal Stairway to Heaven right in your living room. Each step feels like you’re ascending to a higher plane of fitness. By the third step, I was convinced I could see my house from space. The workout is no joke. After just a few minutes, my legs were burning like I had climbed Mount Everest. But the best part? I didn’t even have to leave my house or put on real pants. Take that, gym membership! ◡̈” — FunkyFeedback  “I recently purchased the Stair Stepper with Resistance Bands, primarily to target my thighs, and it has exceeded my expectations. The stepper is incredibly easy to pedal, making it user-friendly even for beginners. You can start using it right out of the box with really minimal setup. One of the best features is the option to use the resistance bands or not. With the bands, you get a comprehensive workout that targets your thighs and arms. Without the bands, you still get a good cardio session, but the resistance on the thighs isn’t as intense. […] You can be creative with your movements, which keeps the workout interesting. I especially enjoy adopting side-to-side hip movements, which also benefit the waist area. This versatility makes the exercise more enjoyable and less monotonous. […] My stepper isn’t particularly noisy. However, I try to avoid using it late at night as even the minimal noise can seem louder in the quiet of the night. […] You can easily store it under the bed, on the balcony, or under your office desk, making it perfect for small spaces. Overall, this stepper is a fantastic addition to my home gym. It’s fun, effective, and offers a great workout for both the lower and upper body. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enhance their fitness routine!” — Fany MAPPAH (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.)  “I bought this Stair Stepper on August 19, 2024. I must say that I am highly impressed !! It comes fully assembled, but for adding the Resistance Bands, which is very easy to do !! It is solidly built, and easy to use. Going on vacation, then take it with you !! It is an excellent leg workout, that will increase your heart rate, burn calories, and cause a good sweat !! It has a monitor that I am not real familiar with yet, as I have other monitors that I like to use !! To be honest, I wish it did not have a monitor, as I have thoughts about removing it, if possible !! Today is August 20, 2024 , and I have only used this stepper six times, so it is my plan to come back in a month or two and rewrite this review !! As it stands right now, I highly recommend this Stair Stepper !! FIVE STARS and TWO BIG THUMBS UP !!” — Frank  “This stepper is amazing. I workout regularly however this thing gives me a WORKOUT and quick! After just one week of regular stepping (about 15 mins a day), I received 3 out of the blue compliments on how my legs looked toned and fit. They asked what I was doing, my response - mini stepper! I’ve worked out regularly for years and nothing… however first week I get this thing and people already take notice. I love the workout it gives, how easy it is to use, portability, and how convenient it is to store. I love this thing so much I am going to buy another, however if it was up to me I’d like to make the ability to have the steps be adjustable to being wider.. as sometimes I feel like my legs are too close when I’m stepping. The value for what you get is amazing, and I definitely recommend getting one!” — Amazon Customer  “I bought this after seeing it on TikTok! I’m a 23F and I’m unable to go on walks on my own bc of my living environment (unsafe). So I’m not really getting in the daily steps that I need. I didn’t end up putting the arm straps on this because I use weights I already own to lift when I walk on here. This machine also pairs well with ankle or arm weights! I like how you can adjust the resistance and it’s pretty easy to use. I either will go on here for a short burst or I’ll walk on it while I’m watching a movie or a show. Depending on your form while walking it can target different areas like your hips, butt, abdomen, thighs, or calves. Some people complained about theirs making a sound, but so far I’ve had no issues with that. Mine is super quiet and I haven’t noticed it creating any heat. I live on a first floor so I wouldn’t worry about it anyways, but if you’re on a second you should be able to use it without worry. This definitely was worth the purchase!!” — MatthewMorrisishot  “I saw this machine on tik tok and it was getting such amazing reviews. I wasn’t sure tho bc hey it’s tik tok and we all know how that can go, I also wasn’t sure about purchasing through tiktok shop. I found it on Amazon and even tho it was a little more then what they were advertising in tik tok I didn’t care since Amazon is so much more secure. It came fast, was not as heavy as I thought it would be, fits perfectly anywhere in my house, and the best part… baby I tried it and it was a workout. Totally felt like I had been on the stair climber at the gym except the time went by so much faster since I was at home watching my shows, checking emails all while working out. Started sweating and felt my heart rate increase after about 10 mins. I didn’t have to put it together it just came straight out the box, all you have to do is attach the resistance bands which are a great add on that doesn’t come with the stair climber at the gym” — JustJackie  “I have had a failed back surgery, then I had a spinal cord stimulator implant which is helping, so now with this stepper, I am finally able to get some strength back into my legs. I really love this small footprint exercise equipment piece in my spare bedroom. Easy to use and will help with stability as we age. It is so worth the money. You won’t be disappointed” — C.

    "title": "A 17-year-old Shooter Killed A Female Student, Himself At A Nashville High School, Police Say",
    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A female student was killed and another student was wounded Wednesday in a shooting in a Nashville high school cafeteria, nearly two years after another deadly school shooting in the city that ignited an emotional debate about gun control in Tennessee. The 17-year-old shooter, who was also a student at Antioch High School, later shot and killed himself with a handgun, Metro Nashville Police spokesperson Don Aaron said during a news conference. Police identified him as Solomon Henderson. Police Chief John Drake said the shooter “confronted” a 16-year-old female student in the cafeteria and opened fire, killing her. Police identified her as Josselin Corea Escalante. Drake said police are looking into a motive and whether he targeted the specific students he shot. The male student who was wounded suffered a graze and was treated and released from the hospital, Drake said. Another student was taken to a hospital for treatment of a facial injury that happened during a fall, Aaron said. There were two school resource officers in the building when the shooting happened around 11 a.m. CDT, Aaron said. They were not in the immediate vicinity of the cafeteria and by the time they got down there the shooting was over and the gunman had killed himself, Aaron said. The school has about 2,000 students and is located in Antioch, a neighborhood about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of downtown Nashville. At a family safety center close to a hospital, officials were helping shocked parents to reunite with their children. Dajuan Bernard was waiting at a Mapco service station to reunite with his son, a 10th grader, who was being held in the auditorium with other students on Wednesday afternoon. He first heard of the shooting from his son who “was a little startled,” Bernard said. His son was upstairs from the cafeteria but said he heard the gunfire. “He was OK and let me know that everything was OK,” Bernard said. “This world is so crazy, it could happen anywhere,” he said. “We’ve just got to protect the kids, and raise the kids right to prevent them from even doing this. That’s the hardest part.” Fonda Abner, whose granddaughter is a student at the school, said Antioch High does not have metal detectors that would alert officials to the presence of a gun. She said her granddaughter had called her a couple of times but that she only heard commotion and thought it was a pocket dial. They spoke briefly before being cut off. “It’s nerve-wracking waiting out here,” Abner said. United Family Fellowship, a church located in Antioch, was hosting a vigil Wednesday night “for anyone in the community who needs a space to pray, process, and find comfort,” the church said on Facebook. Adrienne Battle, superintendent of Nashville schools, said earlier Wednesday that public schools have implemented a “range of safety measures,” including partnerships with police for school resource officers, security cameras with weapon-detection software, shatter-resistant film for glass, and security vestibules that are a barrier between outside visitors and the main entrance. “Unfortunately, these measures were not enough to stop this tragedy,” Battle said. She noted that there are questions about whether stationary metal detectors should be considered. “While past research has shown they have had limitations and unintended consequences, we will continue to explore emerging technologies and strategies to strengthen school safety,” Battle said. In October, a 16-year-old Antioch High School student was arrested after school resource officers and school officials discovered through social media that he had taken a gun to school the prior day. When he was stopped the following morning, officials found a loaded gun in his pants, police said. Wednesday’s school shooting comes nearly two years after a shooter opened fire at a separate Nashville private elementary school and killed six people, including three children. The tragedy prompted a monthslong effort among hundreds of community organizers, families, protesters and many more pleading with lawmakers to consider passing gun control measures in response to the shooting. However, in a Republican-dominant state, GOP lawmakers refused to do so. With the Republican supermajority intact after November’s election, it’s unlikely attitudes have changed enough to consider any meaningful bills that would address gun control. Instead, lawmakers have been more open to adding more security to schools — including passing a bill last year that would allow some teachers and staff to carry concealed handguns on public school grounds, and bar parents and other teachers from knowing who was armed. Antioch, a growing and diverse area of Nashville, has endured other prominent shootings in recent years. A 2017 fatal shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ killed one woman and wounded seven people. And in 2018, a shooter killed four people at a Waffle House. State Rep. Shaundelle Brooks ran for office in large part due to her son’s death in the Waffle House shooting and was elected last year after the Covenant shooting. She said the Antioch High shooting reinforces the need for gun control reforms. “We must do better,” she said. “Ever since I lost my son, Akilah, in a mass shooting in 2018, I have been fighting to ensure this never happens again,” the Nashville Democrat said in a statement. “Here we are almost 7 years later, and our communities are still being impacted by gun violence.” Samantha Dickerson had taken her 14-year-old son’s phone away as a punishment, so when she got a message from his school about the shooting, she had no way to reach him. “I was nervous,” she said. “I really was about to break down.” After about three hours of waiting, she finally got a call from his English teacher and spoke with her son. “When I heard his voice, I just broke down and started crying,” she said. ___ Associated Press writers Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville and Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee, contributed.

    "title": "Netflix Is Raising Its Prices Again — And People Are Pissed",
    "text": "On Tuesday, Netflix announced that it is raising its prices once again. The streaming giant said its increase will affect all U.S. subscribers on their next billing cycle, The Verge reported. The basic monthly subscription without ads will increase from $15.49 to $17.99. The monthly plan with ads will increase from $6.99 to $7.99. The premium plan subscription has increased by $2, up to $24.99 a month. The last time the streamer increased prices was in October 2023. “As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix,” Netflix said in a letter to investors. This 2025 price hike follows a record increase in new subscribers for the platform; in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, 19 million users subscribed to the streamer, NPR reported. In 2023, Netflix began cracking down on password sharing on the app, encouraging users who shared accounts outside of their households to download the service and create their own accounts. Apparently, that shift worked for Netflix — the app’s sign-ups increased after the password-sharing ban took effect in the U.S., Canada, Portugal, Spain and New Zealand, CNN reported. Netflix currently has 302 million global subscribers. Needless to say, several social media users are complaining about the price increase. And hey, there are a number of reasons why this news pissed off so many people. Let’s first talk about how Netflix loves to cancel a show after just one season — I personally am still upset about “Society,” the suspenseful teen drama that was unceremoniously canceled in 2019. netflix keep jacking up the prices to bankroll shows they intend to cancel after 1 season https://t.co/b1bJql3S42 pic.twitter.com/sZOTSatyc1 Then, let’s talk about how they’ve clearly invested a bunch of money in these virtual games, and I’m convinced no one is actually playing them. there's no reason for @netflix to raise their prices and there's literally no reason for them to have stupid games ??? like who even plays them??? This user has the right idea — let’s evaluate how much time we actually spend on the service. Maybe having ads won’t be so bad. For those users who are only waiting for the next season of “Love Is Blind,” or, say, the long-awaited final season of “Stranger Things,” maybe we downgrade. Netflix raising their prices again? Man I may need to seriously consider how often I #really watch Netflix to see if downgrading to the Ads option would be the best idea bc whew pic.twitter.com/kJYFMdBThF Speaking of “Stranger Things”... Price hike for what?!? It takes them two years to make 8 episodes of a show that they are sourcing from books! Those stranger things kids are now middle aged adults! I hate #Netflix 🤣 https://t.co/whhFP02Eh4 Perhaps most egregious of all, it definitely does seem downright greedy to raise prices after the company reported record subscriber growth. How much money do you need, Netflix? Netflix raises prices AGAIN after a record-breaking subscriber growth. What are WE getting from this? Because they need the $$$, Right? Remember when they fired all those people and did the Squid Game Competition show that goes against the actual message of the show. 🗑️🗑️🗑️ pic.twitter.com/eNyrapwen4 Why aren’t more people outraged that @netflix is raising their prices again after having a record Q4.

Dear @netflix you pricing is truly getting ridiculous.And to say the reason is because you had a jump in subscribers well yes because you took away sharing so of course those that were sharing an account had to join with their own account. Of course you would have more. WTF is going on at @Netflix? Added more subs in a quarter in history, cut account sharing, and raising prices less than 18 mos since last hike. No one asked for live sports and this is no longer \"a little more\". You're pricing into the \"don't really need it\" territory. #netflix If nothing else, it’d be great for Netflix to get a wealth of good and consistent programming on the streamer — so that the higher prices might seem worth it.

    "title": "New L.A. District Attorney Meets With Menendez Brothers' Family As He Reviews Their Bid For Freedom",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The new Los Angeles County District Attorney met with the Menendez brothers’ family as he continues to review their bid for freedom 35 years after they were convicted of killing their parents. Nathan Hochman, who took office in December, said Friday that he had a “productive session” with the family members, who shared their thoughts with him on whether the brothers should be released. The meeting lasted about three hours. Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Now in their 50s, they began their bid for freedom in recent years after new evidence of their father’s sexual abuse emerged in their case. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition — a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained — in May 2023, asking a judge to consider the evidence. The brothers have the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that in today’s world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life. In October 2024, then-District Attorney George Gascon recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for parole. Hochman, who was running against Gascon, called it a “desperate political move.” “By releasing it now, Gascon has cast a cloud over the fairness and impartiality of his decision,” he said at the time. A judge delayed the brothers’ resentencing hearing, originally set for early December, to the end of January. Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic said he needed time to review extensive evidence and give Hochman time to weigh in on the case. Hochman said Friday he was still reviewing thousands of pages of prison records to “analyze the rehabilitation aspect of resentencing.” Evidence of rehabilitation could include not engaging in illegal activity while in prison, starting organizations that helped other prisoners, and using that time to improve oneself, he said. At the brothers’ original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "It's Not Clear Who Will Lead The Pentagon When Trump Takes Office. What Happens Then?",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — It is unclear who will take over at the Pentagon and the military services when the top leaders all step down Monday as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. As of Friday, officials said they had not yet heard who will become the acting defense secretary. Officials said the military chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force were getting ready to step in as acting service secretaries — a rare move — because no civilians had been named or, in some cases, had turned down the opportunity. As is customary, all current political appointees will step down as of noon EST on Inauguration Day, leaving hundreds of key defense posts open, including dozens that require Senate confirmation. In addition to the top job and all three service secretaries, all of their deputies and senior policy staff will leave. The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to vote Monday on Trump’s choice to head the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, but the full Senate vote may not happen until days later. As a result someone from the Biden administration would have to take over temporarily. For the service secretaries, officials said that while things could still change before the inauguration, the Trump team is eyeing Gen. Randy George, chief of staff of the Army, to be that service’s temporary head. They said Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, and Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the Navy chief, are aware they may have to step in if no civilian is named as acting secretary, and they are preparing for that possibility. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said many senior Biden administration leaders are reluctant to serve in the incoming Trump administration because they are concerned about policy changes they may be required to handle or enforce. Usually, only people appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate serve as a defense or service secretary, including in an acting capacity during a transition. Trump could pull a confirmed member of the Biden administration from another agency and put that person at the Pentagon. Civilian control of the military is a key tenet, but under the law the military chiefs of the services — who are all Senate confirmed — can take over on a temporary basis. It’s rare, but did happen more than 30 years ago. Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine Corps Reserve two-star general, said that in 1993, Adm. Frank Kelso, who was Navy chief, was asked to serve as acting Navy secretary when Bill Clinton became president because civilian leaders did not step up. “It doesn’t happen very often,” said Punaro, who spent 14 years as a staff director on the Senate Armed Services Committee and has advised nominees through the confirmation process for decades. “Normally you don’t want the active-duty military serving in the civilian control positions. The practical reality is they are wearing both hats.” The transition to a new secretary of defense has usually been an orderly process. Four years ago, the deputy secretary of defense under Trump, David Norquist, became acting secretary for the two-day gap between the inauguration of Democratic President Joe Biden and the Senate vote to confirm Lloyd Austin as Pentagon chief. President Barack Obama asked his Republican predecessor’s defense secretary, Robert Gates, to stay on as his own Pentagon leader in 2009. In 2017, Jim Mattis, Trump’s pick to be secretary during his first term, was confirmed on Inauguration Day. Various administrations have handled the handover differently. In many cases, people have been asked to stay on in a temporary role. In one recent instance, officials said, the comptrollers of the services stepped in as acting secretaries because a key job in the coming months is to put together the massive, complex budget and more often the money people are considered less political. This year’s gap is further complicated by the fact that Trump and Hegseth have both pledged ro rid the Defense Department of what they call “woke” generals — or those who have supported diversity programs. That raises the possibility that even as the administration struggles to fill its political appointee slots, it may also be carving holes in the military leadership structure that will have to be filled. When Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., asked Hegseth during his nomination hearing if he intended to fire the current Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. CQ Brown, he answered, “Senator, every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy, standards, lethality, and commitment to lawful orders they will be given.” Hegseth previously said that Brown should be fired. Conservative groups have compiled lists of generals they believe should be fired for supporting diversity programs. If Brown is fired, the vice chairman would take over until a new chairman is confirmed. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

It additionally postponed the traditional announcement from Friday, Jan. 17, to the following Tuesday. “We want to offer our deepest condolences to those who have been impacted by the devastating fires across Southern California,” they wrote, per EW. “So many of our members and industry colleagues live and work in the Los Angeles area, and we are thinking of you.” The Oscars weren’t alone in altering or postponing their upcoming events: The SAG Awards replaced a traditional nominations announcement scheduled for Thursday with a virtual press release; the Critics Choice Awards postponed Sunday’s ceremony to Jan. 26. The academy announced their changes mere hours after voting began, as residents from the Pacific Coast inland to Pasadena were placed under evacuation orders. The fires have reportedly burned down more than 27,000 acres and killed at least five people. Production has reportedly halted on numerous television shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Hacks,” whose Golden Globe-winning star, Jean Smart, urged upcoming awards shows to cancel their telecasts entirely — and donate the would-be profits to victims of the fires. The burgeoning list of actors affected by these fires, meanwhile, includes Mandy Moore, Mark Hamill, Anna Faris, Jamie Lee Curtis and Steve Guttenberg, who made headlines after helping first responders evacuate his neighborhood in the Pacific Palisades. Tracy Droz Tragos, who reportedly helped capture California’s Camp Fire in 2018 for Ron Howard’s National Geographic documentary “Rebuilding Paradise” (2020), told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday that she lost her Palisades home to the ongoing blaze. Only two of the major fires in Los Angeles County are slowly being contained, per Cal Fire. The Palisades Fire continues to burn with abandon, meanwhile, and has already destroyed more than 1,000 structures to become the most ruinous fire in Los Angeles history.

    "title": "Palestinians Trek Across Rubble To Return Home As Gaza Ceasefire Begins",
    "text": "KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Even before the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was fully in place Sunday, Palestinians in the war-battered Gaza Strip began to return to the remains of the homes they had evacuated during the 15-month war. Majida Abu Jarad made quick work of packing the contents of her family’s tent in the sprawling tent city of Muwasi, just north of the strip’s southern border with Egypt. At the start of the war, they were forced to flee their house in Gaza’s northern town of Beit Hanoun, where they used to gather around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine. The house from those fond memories is gone, and for the past year, Abu Jarad, her husband and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, following one evacuation order after another by the Israeli military. Seven times they fled, she said, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them as they crowded with strangers to sleep in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street. Now the family is preparing to begin the trek home — or to whatever remains of it — and to reunite with relatives who remained in the north. “As soon as they said that the truce would start on Sunday, we started packing our bags and deciding what we would take, not caring that we would still be living in tents,” Abu Jarad said. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. Over 110,000 Palestinians have been wounded, it said. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Israeli military’s bombardment has flattened large swaths of Gaza and displaced 1.9 million of its 2.3 million residents. Even before the ceasefire officially took effect — and as tank shelling continued overnight and into the morning — many Palestinians began trekking through the wreckage to reach their homes, some on foot and others hauling their belongings on donkey carts. “They’re returning to retrieve their loved ones under the rubble,” said Mohamed Mahdi, a displaced Palestinian and father of two. He was forced to leave his three-story home in Gaza City’s southeastern Zaytoun neighborhood a few months ago, Mahdi managed to reach his home Sunday morning, walking amid the rubble from western Gaza. On the road he said he saw the Hamas-run police force being deployed to the streets in Gaza City, helping people returning to their homes. Despite the vast scale of the destruction and uncertain prospects for rebuilding, “people were celebrating,” he said. “They are happy. They started clearing the streets and removing the rubble of their homes. It’s a moment they’ve waited for 15 months.” Um Saber, a 48-year-old widow and mother of six children, returned to her hometown of Beit Lahiya. She asked to be identified only by her honorific, meaning “mother of Saber,” out of safety concerns. Speaking by phone, she said her family had found bodies in the street as they trekked home, some of whom appeared to have been lying in the open for weeks. When they reached Beit Lahiya, they found their home and much of the surrounding area reduced to rubble, she said. Some families immediately began digging through the debris in search of missing loved ones. Others began trying to clear areas where they could set up tents. Um Saber said she also found the area’s Kamal Adwan hospital “completely destroyed.” “It’s no longer a hospital at all,” she said. “They destroyed everything.” The hospital has been hit multiple times over the past three months by Israeli forces waging an offensive in largely isolated northern Gaza against Hamas fighters it says have regrouped. The military has claimed that Hamas militants operate inside Kamal Adwan, which hospital officials have denied. In Gaza’s southern city of Rafah, residents returned to find massive destruction across the city that was once a hub for displaced families fleeing Israel’s bombardment elsewhere in the Palestinian enclave. Some found human remains amid the rubble of houses and the streets. “It’s an indescribable scene. It’s like you see a Hollywood horror movie,” said Mohamed Abu Taha, a Rafah resident, speaking to The Associated Press as he and his brother were inspecting his family home in the city’s Salam neighborhood. “Flattened houses, human remains, skulls and other body parts, in the street and in the rubble.” He shared footage of piles of rubble he said had been his family’s house. “I want to know how they destroyed our home.” The returns come amid looming uncertainty regarding whether the ceasefire deal will bring more than a temporary halt to the fighting, who will govern the enclave and how it will be rebuilt. Not all families will be able to return home immediately. Under the terms of the deal, returning displaced people will only be able to cross the Netzarim corridor from south to north beginning seven days into the ceasefire. And those who do return may face a long wait to rebuild their houses. The United Nations has said that reconstruction could take more than 350 years if Gaza remains under an Israeli blockade. Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including over 245,000 homes. With over 100 trucks working full-time, it would take more than 15 years just to clear the rubble away, But for many families, the immediate relief overrode fears about the future. “We will remain in a tent, but the difference is that the bleeding will stop, the fear will stop, and we will sleep reassured,” Abu Jarad said. —— Magdy reported from Cairo.

    "title": "Trump Pardons All Jan. 6 Rioters On Day 1",
    "text": "President Donald Trump, free from the burden of his own indictment for allegedly conspiring to subvert the results of the 2020 election, on Monday signed an executive order pardoning people who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While signing a series of executive orders at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said he was pardoning about 1,500 defendants charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol — including those who assaulted police — and issuing some commutations. The order says it grants “a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” “So this is Jan. 6,” he said as he received the executive order. “These are the hostages. Approximately 1,500 were pardoned. Full pardon.” “We hope they come out tonight, frankly,” he added. Among those who received commutations were members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers who had been convicted of seditious conspiracy and other serious charges. In the lead-up to his second administration, Trump was cagey about how far he would go with clemency for some of the more than 1,580 individuals charged with various crimes connected to Jan. 6. Approximately 1,100 defendants have been sentenced so far, and arrests are ongoing. According to the Department of Justice, as of Jan. 4, 608 people were charged with assaulting police, 174 were convicted of using a deadly and dangerous weapon, and at least 180 were charged with entering the Capitol carrying a dangerous or deadly weapon. Those weapons included guns, pepper spray, axes, hatchets, swords, knives and a variety of makeshift weapons transported from home or made on the fly from items such as metal barriers, flagpoles, sticks and police shields.

    "title": "Pete Davidson Reveals Why 'SNL' Refused To Fire Him, Even When He Asked For It",
    "text": "Lorne Michaels felt that BDE. Pete Davidson admitted to having major impostor syndrome when he first started at “Saturday Night Live.” The comedian made the confession in Peacock’s docuseries “SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night” — which premiered Thursday and includes numerous “SNL” alums looking back at the iconic sketch show’s past as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. In the doc, the “King of Staten Island” star recalled making a weird request to the show’s creator, Lorne Michaels, after his first season. “After my first year, I actually called for a meeting with Lorne and I was like, ‘Please fire me,’ and he’s like, ‘Why?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t belong here. Everybody’s so talented and they don’t want to be my friend,’” Davidson recalled, per People. As he laughed at himself, Davidson continued: “Because I was a child. I was like, ‘Nobody wants to be my friend.’” But it seems that Michaels saw something in Davidson that the comedian hadn’t yet seen in himself — and wasn’t about to let him go. “And he said, ‘You don’t figure it out ’til your third or fourth year,’” Davidson recalled. “‘It’s just gonna suck for three or four years.’ And he was right.” Davidson joined the show in 2014 when he was 20. He ended up staying on the show until 2022. During his final episode, Davidson delivered a farewell message during the “Weekend Update” segment and gave Michaels a sweet shout-out.

    "title": "Pete Hegseth Says Alcohol Allegations Are 'False,' Also Vows Not To Drink On Job",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Defense said Tuesday that all the reports of his excessive drinking were false. Pete Hegseth also said at his confirmation hearing that he wouldn’t drink another drop if he’s confirmed by the Senate to lead the U.S. military. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) first confronted Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran, about allegations he had a drinking problem. “I have read multiple reports of your regularly being drunk at work, including by people who worked with you at Fox News,” Hirono said. “Senator, those are multiple false anonymous reports peddled by NBC News that run directly contradictory to the dozens of men and women at Fox News Channel who I worked with and said they never saw that,” Hegseth said. Allegations of alcohol abuse, financial mismanagement and sexual misconduct have dogged Hegseth since Trump announced him as his choice to lead the Defense Department. Hegseth is one of several Trump nominees who are so controversial it’s possible they won’t win votes from 50 of the 53 Republicans in the Senate, meaning Trump would have to pick someone else. Already, one of Trump’s top nominees, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), withdrew from consideration to be attorney general rather than face a doomed Senate confirmation vote. But no Republicans have said they would definitely oppose Hegseth, and none asked any hard questions about his personal conduct on Tuesday. NBC News reported in December that seven former and three current Fox News employees said Hegseth’s drinking concerned them, with some saying he showed up to the studio hungover ahead of his early morning TV duties. Contrary to Hegseth, it wasn’t just NBC News and anonymous sources talking about his drinking ― Hegseth himself has repeatedly discussed his affinity for alcohol. “The less booze thing is not working out for me,” Hegseth said on a podcast in January 2024, as part of a conversation about New Year’s resolutions, in one example the New York Times highlighted Tuesday as part of a pattern of public comments Hegseth has made about his own partying. Hirono noted that Hegseth recently told several Republican senators that he wouldn’t drink if confirmed, a vow he also made in an interview with Megyn Kelly. “Absolutely,” Hegseth said Tuesday. “I made this commitment on behalf of the men and women I’m serving.” Hirono asked Hegseth if he would resign as Secretary of Defense if he wound up drinking again, but he didn’t commit to doing so. Later during the hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) also grilled Hegseth about his drinking, noting that a whistleblower report from Hegseth’s tenure as CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, a nonprofit group, detailed excessive drinking and even an instance of Hegseth’s co-workers having to physically restrain him. (The internal report was revealed by the New Yorker.) “Those are all anonymous, false claims,” Hegseth said. “They’re not anonymous. We’ve seen records with names attached,” Kaine said. “One of your colleagues said that you got drunk at an event at a bar and chanted ‘Kill all Muslims.’ Another colleague ― not anonymous, we have this ― said that you took co-workers to a strip club, you were drunk, you tried to dance with strippers, you had to be held offstage.” Kaine asked if the allegation would be disqualifying if it were true. “Senator, anonymous, false charges,” Hegseth said. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) defended Hegseth by arguing that senators, too, are sometimes drunk on the job. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "'A Disgrace': The Pope Raises Holy Hell Over Trump's Biggest 'Day 1' Promise",
    "text": "Pope Francis on Sunday spoke out against President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to launch a massive migrant deportation program on his first day in office. “If it is true, it will be a disgrace, because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill for the imbalance,” the pontiff said on Italian television’s “Che Tempo Che Fa,” according to a CNN translation. “It won’t do. This is not the way to solve things.” Trump has repeatedly vowed to launch a sweeping deportation program immediately after taking office on Monday. “On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out,” he said in October. He repeated that promise at a pre-inauguration rally on Sunday. “By the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will have come to a halt,” he said in Washington. Politico said Trump is set to sign an executive order declaring a crisis at the southern border on Monday, while The Wall Street Journal reported on plans for raids and deportations in Chicago on Tuesday. Cardinal Blase Cupich, archbishop of Chicago, also spoke out against the reported details of Trump’s plan. “While we wish the new administration success in promoting the common good, the reports being circulated of planned mass deportations targeting the Chicago area are not only profoundly disturbing but also wound us deeply,” he said in a statement posted online, adding that “indiscriminate mass deportation ... would be an affront to the dignity of all people and communities, and deny the legacy of what it means to be an American.” Trump took a similar hard line on immigration during his previous term in office ― and the pope was critical then as well. When asked about Trump’s promise to build a border wall in 2016, the pope said: “A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.” In 2018, he called the Trump administration’s family separation policy for undocumented migrants “contrary to our Catholic values” and “immoral.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

And when asked in 2019 about Trump’s threat to close the border with Mexico, Francis replied: “Builders of walls, be they made of razor wire or bricks, will end up becoming prisoners of the walls they build.” He did allow that immigration is a difficult issue, but said it should be solved “humanely, not with razor wire.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Priest’s License Revoked By Church After Copying Musk's Salute At Anti-Abortion Summit",
    "text": "A Michigan priest had his license revoked by the Anglican Catholic Church after he mimicked Elon Musk’s controversial straight-arm gesture, which many have likened to a Nazi salute, during a speech. The church announced it dismissed Calvin Robinson as a priest and rescinded his license after he made the gesture at the end of his speech Saturday during the National Pro-Life Summit in Washington, D.C. “The Holocaust was an episode of unspeakable horror, enacted by a regime of evil men,” the Anglican Catholic Church said in a statement on its website. “We condemn Nazi ideology and anti-Semitism in all its forms.” The statement continued, “And we believe that those who mimic the Nazi salute, even as a joke or an attempt to troll their opponents, trivialize the horror of the Holocaust and diminish the sacrifice of those who fought against its perpetrators. Such actions are harmful, divisive, and contrary to the tenets of Christian charity.” The church said Robinson previously had been “warned that online trolling and other such actions (whether in service of the left or right) are incompatible with a priestly vocation and was told to desist.” Elsewhere in the church’s statement, it said “members of the College of Bishops of the ACC were made aware” of Robinson’s gesture about 3 p.m. Wednesday from “a post made on X [formerly Twitter] showing the end of” Robinson’s speech. HuffPost has reached out to the Anglican Catholic Church for comment. Musk’s gesture that Robinson was imitating occurred during the Tesla co-founder’s Jan. 20 speech at a post-inauguration celebration for President Donald Trump. Musk slapped his chest and then thrust the same arm straight out into the air with his palm down in a manner that resembled a Nazi salute. He then turned around and did the same movement again, telling the crowd “My heart goes out to you.” Musk denied the accusations in a Jan. 20 tweet, writing, “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” Robinson also denied being a Nazi or doing a Nazi salute during the summit, saying in a Facebook post the gesture was “a joke” meant to chastise “liberals.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Context is key, but sometimes people ignore context to confirm their own prejudices. People see what they want to see,” he wrote. Robinson went on to blame his actions on his “attempt at dry wit” before questioning whether the public’s “responses have been proportionate.” “My attempt at dry wit, in that typical British way, was not a joke at the expense of WW II, nor an admission of my membership in the Nationalist Socialist Party,” he continued in his post. “You can consider my joke crass.

    "title": "More Than 700 In Public Health Call On Senate To Reject RFK Jr.’s ‘Fringe,’ ‘Dangerous’ Views",
    "text": "A coalition of hundreds of scientists and medical professionals urged the Senate to reject Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, saying his “fringe beliefs” could be dangerous to the U.S. and the rest of the world. The letter, released Monday by a group calling itself “Defend Public Health,” includes more than 700 signatories from many universities, including public health schools at Yale and Harvard. The coalition argues that Kennedy is unqualified to lead the nation’s health agencies, which include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. “He has little to no relevant administrative, policy or health experience or expertise that would prepare him to oversee the work of critical public health agencies,” the letter reads. “The nation’s health department must be led by someone who respects and believes in science — robust basic research, pandemic preparedness and evidence-based approaches to all conditions that threaten Americans’ lives and well-being and are designed to protect us from cradle to grave.” Hello BlueSky! We are a grassroots organization of thousands of public health professionals who are dedicated to sharing evidence-based public health science. We will post about our actions here and let you know how you can get involved. We look forward to interacting with you! Stay tuned. The authors point directly to Kennedy’s long history of spreading unfounded conspiracy theories about vaccines among his other fringe views on water fluoridation and foods like raw milk. His nomination, they continue, is “unfathomable” even for President-elect Donald Trump, saying the man could undo years of progress developing vaccines under his first administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. “His unfounded, fringe beliefs could significantly undermine public health practices across the country and around the world,” the letter reads.

    "title": "Reese Witherspoon Just Cast Her Vote For Sexiest Man Alive, And It's Not Who You'd Think",
    "text": "Being named to People’s “Sexiest Man Alive” list is considered an honor by many, and now Reese Witherspoon is throwing her weight behind the magazine’s next honoree. On Tuesday, while talking with People at the premiere of her movie “You’re Cordially Invited,” Witherspoon was joined by her costar Will Ferrell — and together, they jokingly resurrected his bid for the coveted title. “Again. I mean, I missed out last year,” Ferrell lamented. Ferrell had launched his Sexiest Man Alive campaign during an appearance on “Today,” a fact he remembered when he returned to the show on Tuesday, where he was reminded that People’s 2024 title went to actor John Krasinski. “I don’t get it,” he said. During the segment, he confessed to receiving “zero votes” with the sort of humility one might expect from a person who had probably already prepared an acceptance speech. But Witherspoon offered nothing but unwavering support for her costar’s bid. “I mean, who else would it be? I can’t think of anybody,” the “Wrinkle In Time” actor told People. Ferrell admitted to the outlet that the notion of winning was “kind of floated out there” and that “people were slightly indoctrinated” about the idea of him claiming the top spot.

As for Ferrell’s campaign strategy, the “Superstar” actor gave “Today” an inside look. “I think I may need to do a preemptive photo shoot,” he said, quipping that “paying for some billboards” might also be in the cards.

    "title": "Scott Jennings Is Dared by WaPo Reporter To Imitate Elon Musk's Salute On CNN",
    "text": "GOP pundit Scott Jennings kept his arm by his side Monday when he was challenged on CNN to mimic Elon Musk’s Nazi-like salute from Inauguration Day. (Watch the video below.) The Washington Post’s issuer of that dare, Catherine Rampell, repeatedly goaded Jennings to act out the gesture to prove it was as harmless as he claimed. The billionaire tech mogul made the arm gesture last week during a celebration for President Donald Trump at Capital One Arena in Washington. Over the weekend, Musk told the far-right Alternative for Germany party that the country has “too much of a focus on past guilt” ― presumably the burden of its Nazi history. His remarks a few days before the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp on Monday put his awkward arm thrust back on the table during Abby Phillip’s “NewsNight.” It wasn’t the first time that Musk perpetuated the controversy in some way. After the Anti-Defamation League and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave him a pass, he posted a bunch of Nazi jokes on X, the social platform he owns formerly known as Twitter. “I don’t understand why this guy keeps getting the benefit of the doubt,” Rampell said of antisemitism accusations against Musk. Jennings said Musk’s awkward arm salute was merely “expressing enthusiastically his appreciation for the crowd.” “Why don’t you do it on TV right now?” Rampell said. “Why don’t you do it on TV right now if you think it’s so, so banal.” Jennings didn’t bite. After more verbal sparring, Jennings added, “This salute trutherism is outrageous.” Rampell, who is Jewish, pressed further. “So do it right now on TV. If you think it’s normal, if you think it’s a normal way to greet people, do it right now on TV. Why won’t you?” Jennings again demurred. It’s his job to serve the network as a conservative “heel,” in pro wrestling parlance. This time he got pinned.

    "title": "8 Secrets About Flight Delays You Need To Know Before Your Next Trip",
    "text": "Flight delays are inevitable, but they can be incredibly frustrating. If you don’t fly very often, you might think the situation is completely out of your hands, and you’ll wind up stewing in annoyance and uncertainty. But there are ways to reduce your risk of facing a flight delay or, at the very least, know when they’re coming, to make the experience less stressful. We asked travel experts to share what many inexperienced passengers don’t know about flight delays and their advice for understanding the process. After all, knowledge is power. It’s useful to download the mobile app for the airline you’re flying to get notifications about gate changes and delays before they even get announced on the screen at the airport. But you can also use it to follow your plane’s journey ahead of its arrival at your airport and anticipate potential delays to your flight. “In the app for your airline, you can often see specifically where the plane is coming from and if it is arriving on time,” said Ravi Roth, queer travel expert and “Gaycation Travel Show” host. There are also a number of non-airline apps and websites that allow you to keep tabs on your flight and previous departures. All you need is your flight number, the airline and the departure date. “FlightAware and Flightradar are two of my favorites, and you are able to track where your flight came from and also where it is in that moment, which I think is so fun to be able to see your plane in real time,” said travel blogger Esther Susag. “Also, just simply checking the published flight status of the plane via a simple Google search can also be much more informative than you think.” “Later flights, which are relying on crew and potentially the plane itself from a prior segment, are more susceptible to be delayed,” said Adit Damodaran, an economist at the travel booking app Hopper. “In other words, an early flight getting delayed can have a ‘ripple effect’ in which subsequent flights are also delayed. We recommend always booking the first flight out if you can to avoid any impact of delays from earlier in the day.” So if you hate flight delays more than you hate waking up at the crack of dawn, opt for a morning flight. Being able to track your plane can also be reassuring when you have a morning flight. “If I wanted to fly from D.C. to Chicago tomorrow, I could book a 6:45 a.m. flight from Dulles and see that the plane will arrive from Los Angeles at 12:45 a.m.,” said Willis Orlando, senior product operations specialist at Scott’s Cheap Flights. “The plane is scheduled to arrive six hours before my flight, so even if there are mass delays, that plane ― or at least a plane ― will be there for me in the morning. Whereas, if I decided on a 1 p.m. flight, my plane would be arriving only an hour beforehand, and the odds increase that there might be a delay due to weather issues, staffing issues, mechanical issues.” Of course, morning flights aren’t immune to delays and other problems. But even if something does happen with your morning flight or it ends up getting canceled, you’ll typically have many more options for getting to your destination on the same day ― whereas a canceled flight in the late afternoon or evening often means having to go home or to a hotel and return to the airport the following day. In addition to booking a morning flight, you can also try to avoid delays by opting for nonstop when possible. “Obviously you lower your odds of being delayed by flying nonstop because there are fewer flights involved,” Orlando said. The nonstop option can cost more money, but you don’t have to go to as many airports and gates. You can also avoid worrying about missing the connection if your first flight is delayed. If you crave that peace of mind and can’t stand delays, paying a little extra might be worth it. That being said, nonstop isn’t always an option. In those cases, you can be strategic about your layover choices with timing and location. Aim to give yourself at least an hour between flights. You should also try to connect through a city that has many flights to your final destination. “Choose a route that’s offered several times in the day,” Orlando advised. “That way your chances of getting rebooked on another flight quickly are better.” Another way to stay on top of flight delays is to think about weather. This also plays into your choice of flight connections. “If you’re flying cross-country on a major U.S. airline and have to make a stop, they have hubs in both warm and cold places,” Orlando explained. “So with United, you could connect through Chicago or Houston. The wise choice would be Houston in the winter to avoid the snow in Chicago and Chicago in the summer to avoid potential tropical storms in Houston.” As your trip approaches, you might want to pay attention to weather patterns at your departure and arrival airports and along the flight route. Being aware of bad storms ahead of time can help you anticipate potential delays, especially around the holidays, when winter storms are a concern. Weather issues in other parts of the country can also have a cascading effect on flights across the U.S., including places that aren’t directly affected. And, of course, weather isn’t the only cause for delays. “Keep in mind that even in clear weather conditions, airlines can still face delays and cancellations as a result of disruptions to incoming flights, staffing issues, technical issues or other unforeseen circumstances, so don’t let clear skies stop you from being vigilant,” said Jen Moyse, senior director of product at TripIt. Federal regulations require airlines to share the on-time flight performance data on their websites. So when you’re scheduling your travel, you can usually see how frequently a given flight arrives on time. Understandably, you might want to opt for one with a higher on-time percentage. If you can’t easily find that data on the airline’s website, there are other places that publish this information, including FlightAware and FlightStats. The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics website also offers statistics on airline and airport delays to give you a better picture before you purchase your ticket. Even if air travel makes you feel like a herded cow, you actually do have rights as a passenger. The Department of Transportation website outlines your rights during a delay at the airport or on the tarmac. “Luckily there are rules tied to tarmac delays, or passengers stuck in a plane waiting on the tarmac,” Moyse said. “Airplanes are required to allow passengers to leave an outbound or inbound plane after three hours for domestic flights, and four for international.” Passengers are also entitled to up-to-date information about their delays from the airline, so don’t hesitate to inquire about what’s going on if you feel it’s been a while since you heard an update. “When I think about flight delays and common mistakes people make, I think about how many times people miss out on the chance to get money back or compensated,” Susag said. “Always, always look at the airline terms and conditions, because most of the time you can always find a way to get a large chunk of what you paid for back when your flight is delayed.” Indeed, eligible passengers traveling in the European Union can be entitled to compensation for flights delayed three hours or more. Your travel insurance plan could also include compensation for delays of a certain duration, so check the fine print. Susag also noted that airlines are obligated to give your refund in money rather than in miles or a credit with the carrier, so ask for cash if you prefer that option. Depending on the circumstances, airlines can also be obliged to cover expenses incurred due to delays or cancellations (like food and hotel accommodations). Additionally, some travel rewards credit cards include trip delay protection, so you could get reimbursed for expenses that the airline won’t cover. If you booked your trip through a third-party travel planner, pay attention to the plan you chose. Apps like Hopper offer plans with compensation or free rebooking options for flights delayed more than one hour, for example. Sometimes travel stakes are high. You might be flying to your wedding weekend or trying to make it home for the holidays for the first time in years. In these instances, it’s helpful to build in a buffer to avoid having a delay derail your plans. “Try to bake some flexibility into your schedule if you can, especially for Christmas and New Year’s holidays coming up,” Damodaran said. “It’s always a good idea to buffer an extra day or so, in case there are disruptions to your trip, to ensure you can make it in time for any holiday festivities.” Delays are normal, especially in peak travel season. The days just before Christmas and New Year’s Eve are some of the busiest of the year, and the air travel industry is still recovering from staffing shortages. “It’s been an unusual year for travel with flight disruptions and changing COVID-19 restrictions,” Moyse noted. “This has led to many heated interactions at the airport and on planes, and a rise in unruly passengers, which have impacted the overall travel experience.” Whatever happens with your flights, taking out your frustration on airport workers will probably not make the experience more pleasant.

    "title": "SEIU Rejoins AFL-CIO After Splitting Off 20 Years Ago",
    "text": "One of the largest and most powerful U.S. unions is rejoining the AFL-CIO, giving the country’s leading labor federation a boost as it prepares for another Donald Trump presidency. The 2 million-member Service Employees International Union announced Wednesday that it had decided to re-affiliate with the federation after a nearly 20-year absence. The SEIU will immediately become the biggest union within the AFL-CIO. Liz Shuler, the federation’s president, called it “a BFD.” “You know that we always say ‘stronger together,’ right?” Shuler told HuffPost. “This is an incredible time for us to be amassing our power, uniting and building our muscle together and really showing the power of solidarity. Because we want to make sure that workers continue to have their voices heard as we are about to enter into this new administration.” The reunion comes at a critical moment for the U.S. labor movement. Union membership has been declining for decades and now hovers near a historic low of just 6% in the private sector. And that trend is unlikely to improve: The incoming Trump administration will probably seek to reverse the labor-friendly reforms under President Joe Biden, while a Republican-controlled Congress won’t make it any easier for workers to form unions. “This is an incredible time for us to be amassing our power.” SEIU President April Verrett said discussions to rejoin the federation long preceded Trump’s November victory, but that the election outcome helped reaffirm the rationale behind the move. “It’s that much more important to come together, to organize workers, to build real power, because that’s our best offense in this moment,” Verrett said. The AFL-CIO is not a union itself — it is an alliance of 61 unions representing roughly 15 million workers. It lends support to member unions’ campaigns and advocates for organized labor in Washington as a major Democratic ally. It is funded by per-capita taxes that unions pay based on their membership numbers. The SEIU could be highly influential within the federation due to its size. It has grown into the second-largest union in the U.S. after decades of organizing workers in health care, child care, custodial work and other service fields. It’s known for its innovative labor campaigns — like the Fight for $15 movement in fast food, which helped spur minimum-wage raises in cities and states around the country — as well as its progressive politics. The reaffiliation means the AFL-CIO can more directly pitch in on SEIU campaigns, including a high-profile one at Starbucks. That effort is led by Workers United, an SEIU affiliate, and has led to more than 500 unionized stores nationwide at the coffee chain, making it one of the most closely watched organizing pushes in decades. The reunion could also help mend old rifts within the labor movement. The SEIU was part of an ugly split from the AFL-CIO in 2005, when it joined the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial Workers and others in forming a rival federation. The breakaway faction said the AFL-CIO was focusing too much on politics and not doing enough to organize new workers. The AFL-CIO’s then-president, John Sweeney, himself a former SEIU leader, called the defection a “grievous insult” to the concept of solidarity. Those unions that left the AFL-CIO have since come back into the fold, with the exception of the Teamsters, which remain unaffiliated. The SEIU’s return was years in the making, according to Shuler and Verrett. Shuler said she wanted to “form a new relationship” with the union after she took the helm at the federation in 2021, replacing the late Richard Trumka. Verrett said she and her predecessor at SEIU, Mary Kay Henry, received a green light from their board to enter formal talks about rejoining the AFL-CIO in 2023. “It was a natural evolution out of many years of conversations,” Shuler said. “We think this is going to be a big game-changer for our movement and for working people broadly.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "Seth Meyers said he had a whole “Closer Look” planned until Donald Trump’s chaotic Tuesday press conference made him throw it out the window. “What a welcome back for us!” the “Late Night” host said Tuesday in his first show since the holidays, describing Trump’s remarks at his Florida Mar-a-Lago club as “one of the most insane press conferences he’s ever had.” He said Trump “claimed, among other things, that special counsel Jack Smith executes people, Wayne Gretzky should run for prime minister of Canada, electric heaters make you itchy, faucets have no water, said he’s going to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, and he won’t rule out using the military to take over Greenland.” The rambling, 70-minute press conference contained a mishmash of grievances, conspiracy theories, boasts, miscellaneous musings and threats. “My man is in mid season form already!” Meyers exclaimed. “We had a whole ‘Closer Look’ written this morning about all the major news stories that had already happened over the break,” he said, adding, “but now that’s all out the window. We got to tear up our script and start over.” “By the way, this already happened almost exactly eight years ago, when I had to shred the script for ‘A Closer Look’ after Trump’s first press conference as president, which was similarly insane,” he lamented. “I can’t believe we’re doing this all over again, except, you know, this time I’m not wearing a suit.” Watch below.

    "text": "A Republican senator’s ranted accusation that the U.S. military has lowered its standards due to diversity, equity and inclusion programs was spectacularly undermined by a typo on a poster behind him. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) railed against DEI initiatives during former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth’s confirmation hearing for defense secretary on Tuesday. But a poster aimed at making his point ― which was behind him ― misspelled the word “military.” Instead, it read: “DEI in our Miltary.” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), whose own grilling of Hegseth in the hearing went viral, shared on social media an image of Schmitt and other GOP lawmakers in front of the poster. “GOP members complaining about reduction of military standards while using a chart that misspells the word military!” Kaine wrote. GOP members complaining about reduction of military standards while using a chart that misspells the word military! The image prompted plenty of snark: If I was a foreign adversary, I’d be looking at the buffoons who are going to be in positions of power in the U.S. and thinking “What an opportune time to take advantage of this.” Are they stupd Hang it in the Louvre Do all the worst people at school who failed at everything become members of the Rupublican party?

    "title": "Snoop Dogg Seemingly Responds To Backlash After Performance At Pro-Trump Crypto Ball",
    "text": "A lot of people were disappointed with Snoop Dogg’s decision to perform at an event celebrating Donald Trump’s inauguration ― but Snoop himself doesn’t seem bothered. In a video posted to Instagram on Sunday, the California rapper is seen in his car nodding along to Anita Baker and the Winans’ “Ain’t No Need to Worry,” before seemingly addressing those who criticized his involvement in the Crypto Ball in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 17. “For all the hate, I’m going to answer it with love,” the rapper said. “Y’all can’t hate enough for me, I love too much.” Snoop, born Calvin Broadus, then addressed his critics directly. “Get your life right,” he advised. “Stop worrying about mine. I’m cool. I’m together.” Based on the social media response, though, he hasn’t persuaded everyone. “Not once have we ever turned our backs on you,” one person commented on the video. “We’ve supported every venture you’ve had. So your performance feels like a slap in our faces.” Snoop’s participation in the event seemed to raise questions about his consistency. In a 2017 video, the rapper took to Instagram to denounce any Black artist willing to perform for Trump as an “Uncle Tom” and a “jigaboo.” Two years later, Snoop got even more emphatic, saying that any government workers who would vote for Trump in 2020 were “stupid motherfuckers.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Passenger Plane Catches Fire At South Korean Airport, All 176 People On Board Evacuated",
    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A passenger plane caught fire before takeoff at an airport in South Korea late Tuesday, but all 176 people on board were safely evacuated, authorities said. The Airbus plane operated by South Korean airline Air Busan was preparing to leave for Hong Kong when its rear parts caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in the southeast, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. The plane’s 169 passengers, six crewmembers and one engineer were evacuated using an escape slide, the ministry said. The National Fire Agency said in a release that three people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation. The fire agency said the fire was completely put out at 11:31 p.m., about one hour after it deployed firefighters and fire trucks at the scene. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. The Transport Ministry said the plane is an A321 model. Tuesday’s incident came a month after a Jeju Air passenger plane crashed at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. It was one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea’s aviation history. The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport’s runaway on Dec. 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into a concrete structure and bursting into flames. The flight was returning from Bangkok and all of the victims were South Koreans except for two Thai nationals. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Spain Mulls 100% Tax On Homes Bought By Non-European Union Buyers",
    "text": "MADRID (AP) — Spain is planning a raft of measures to address its brewing housing crisis, including an up to 100% tax on properties bought by people who are neither citizens nor residents of the European Union. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the plan this week to tackle housing affordability and high rents in the Southern European nation. He said that the overall goal was to provide “more housing, better regulation and greater aid.” “The West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and the poor tenants,” Sánchez said as he announced the plan. However, it remains unclear if the plan put forth by Sánchez’s minority coalition will pass in parliament. Here’s a look at what’s happening: Spain’s housing affordability crisis Like most rich countries, Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas. Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists. Spain sees more tourists than almost any country in the world, having received more than 88.5 million visitors in 2024. Tourism is one of the country’s key economic drivers. The negative aspects of mass tourism have caused tension at times between visitors and residents concerned about rising costs, the proliferation of short-term rentals on platforms like Airbnb, and water supplies that can be stretched in some parts of the country, including the Canary and Balearic Islands. Last year, protesters took to the streets on various occasions across the country to express their frustrations about the growth of tourism and high rents. Barcelona’s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate all short-term rentals to tourists in the coming years. “What citizens expect from us here is action,” Spanish housing minister Isabel Rodríguez told reporters on Tuesday about the plan. Curbing foreigners from buying houses in Spain Spain plans to limit the number of homes foreigners purchase by raising taxes by up to 100% on properties bought by people who are not EU citizens and do not reside in an EU country — often buyers of investment or vacation properties. Sánchez didn’t provide a timeline or details on how he plans to implement the tax. “This would be massive,” said Sarah Conroy, an English real estate agent who has been working in realty in the upscale Marbella market in southern Spain for over three decades. She didn’t give figures on how many non-EU clients she had, but said they included post-Brexit British buyers as well as clients from Saudi Arabia and Dubai. “They need to do something because the people living here can’t really rent anything because it is so expensive,” Conroy said. “Personally speaking, around 80% of the people I sell to are buying second homes.” Last year, Spain announced that it was scrapping its so-called “golden visa” program that allows wealthy people from outside the EU to obtain residency permits by investing more than half a million euros (roughly 515,000 dollars) in real estate. Joan Carlos Amaro, a real estate analyst and professor of economics at the Esade Business School in Barcelona, said that while Spain is suffering a housing crunch, he can’t see how the tax will lead to homeowners or real estate promoters guaranteeing that these normally high-end properties end up in the hands of middle-class Spaniards. “Anything that puts up barriers and stops the market from functioning ends up hurting everyone,” Amaro said in Barcelona. “These foreigners that come, they spend money, the houses they live in have to be built and that creates jobs.” Amaro added that he saw it more as a political move than one with a sound economic rationale. Some of the other measures put forth Spain plans to build more public housing and allocate around 2 million square meters (21.5 million square feet) of residential land to a newly created public housing agency. Other proposed measures include higher taxes on holiday rentals, tax breaks and protections for landlords who provide affordable housing, and amending laws to speed up construction processes and expand the availability of land for private construction. Why is housing politically important in Spain? The rising cost of living has driven voter discontent across many wealthy countries in recent years, including the United States. But as one of Europe’s leading Socialist politicians, the housing crunch is a crucial question for Sánchez to resolve as he tries to keep his left-wing minority coalition afloat after winning another four-year term in 2023.

    "title": "Steve Guttenberg Helps First Responders As Wildfires Devastate Los Angeles Area",
    "text": "Steve Guttenberg is among the citizens who have been volunteering their time as devastating wildfires continue to rage across the Los Angeles area of Southern California. The actor, known for films like “Police Academy” and “Three Men and a Baby,” was seen Tuesday urging residents of LA’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood to leave their keys behind in their cars so that they could be moved to make way for first responders in emergency vehicles. “What’s happening is, people take their keys with them as if they’re in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot,” he told local news channel KTLA. “If you leave your car on Palisades Drive, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car ... so that these fire trucks can get up there.” Watch KTLA’s interview with Guttenberg below. Despite his decadeslong Hollywood career, Guttenberg was not recognized by KTLA reporter Gene Kang at first. It was only after Guttenberg, who has resided in Pacific Palisades for about 30 years, identified himself as an actor that Kang said he recognized him. In a separate interview with CNN, Guttenberg said he hadn’t “seen anything like this in my entire life, and I don’t think many people have.” He also discussed his experience helping to rescue pets belonging to a neighbor who happened to be out of town as the fires raged. “This is the time for us to remember that we’re part of a community,” Guttenberg said, adding that people “have to help each other and be kind to each other. If you see somebody who needs help, help them. Ask them what they need.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "9 Everyday Stretches That Can Do Wonders For Your Sex Life",
    "text": "We all know stretching comes with a host of benefits, including pain relief, better posture and reduced risk of injury. Now it’s time to consider adding it to your daily routine for another important reason: your sex life. “Stretching can improve your sex life by increasing flexibility and range of motion, stamina, strength and body awareness, as well as [reduce] stress and anxiety,” fitness and wellness coach Kylie Larson told HuffPost. “Some stretches can also strengthen the pelvic floor, improve blood flow and enhance sexual desire.” She noted stretching relieves muscle tension and stress, which can boost your libido and sexual satisfaction. Increased range of motion can also give you the freedom to explore different sexual positions. Stretching also fosters relaxation mindfulness in intimacy, empowering you to better communicate your desires. “Being flexible and limber allows you to explore movement more freely, while relieving tightness ― especially in areas like the hips and lower back ― helps you feel more comfortable and confident,” said Ashley Rogers, head instructor at Reform Pilates LA. “Stretching is as much about flexibility as it is about connection ― connection with your body, your breath, and how you feel.” Although all forms of stretching carry benefits, but some are particularly suited to boost your sexual experience. Continue scrolling for nine examples of everyday stretches that will do wonders for your sex life. “Hip flexibility is important for sex, so stretches that promote mobility in the hips such as the ‘pigeon pose’ in yoga can be beneficial,” said Laura Morris, a certified personal trainer and nutrition consultant. She noted that this move also reduces tightness in the groin area. For the pigeon pose or pigeon stretch, you get in a low lunge position with one knee bent in front of you while extending the other leg straight back. Lower your body so that your front bent leg is flat on the floor with your foot toward the opposite hip. “Hip mobility stretches allow for a wider range of motion and greater comfort during intimate activities,” Morris said. A simple seated forward fold can also be beneficial to your sex life. Just sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you and toes flexed, then inhale and reach forward, hinging at the hips. Try to touch your feet and hold the position. “This stretch lengthens the hamstrings and lower back while promoting relaxation,” Rogers said. “Loosening tight hamstrings and relieving lower back tension can enhance comfort and make movement feel more natural.” Another good stretch for hip mobility is the butterfly stretch, which involves sitting on the floor with the soles of your feet touching and your knees out wide to your sides. Sit tall, then lean forward and hold for 30 seconds. “This stretch targets the inner thighs and groin, areas directly involved in many movements during intimacy,” Rogers said. “Improving flexibility here can make certain positions more comfortable while reducing strain.” “Flowing movements, such as cat-cow, not only stretch key muscles but also create a sensual, flowing rhythm to help you feel more connected to your body,” Larson said. To do a cat-cow, get on your hands and knees with your wrists below your shoulders and knees below your hips. Breathe in and arch your back while lifting your head to face the ceiling (the cow). Then, breathe out and round your back toward the ceiling, with your head pointed down to the floor (the cat). “This dynamic stretch increases spinal mobility, relieves tension in the lower back, and improves pelvic awareness,” Rogers said. “It’s also great for syncing breath with movement, which can make you more mindful and present in intimate moments.” “Any hip opener, like runner’s lunge, increases blood flow and loosens tight hips,” Larson said. To do a runner’s lunge, simply step one leg forward into a lunge position, with your front knee bent at 90 degrees directly above your ankle and your other leg back straight behind you with your toes bent on the floor. Put your fingers on the floor on either side of that front leg and sink your hips down to feel the stretch. “Tight hips are a common issue, especially for people who sit a lot,” Rogers said. “Stretching your hip flexors improves hip mobility, making movement easier and more fluid during intimacy.” “This yoga pose opens up the hips and stretches the inner thighs and lower back, promoting flexibility and relaxation in areas that play a big role in sexual activity,” Rogers said. “It’s also a great way to release tension and bring attention to your breath.” For the happy baby pose, you lie on your back and bend your knees, bringing them toward your chest. Spread your knees out wider than your torso and bring them toward your armpits. Then, flex your feet and reach your hands up to grab the outer edges of your feet. Breathe deeply and rock from side to side. “It’s playful and perfect for getting in tune with your body,” Larson said. Child’s pose is often considered a sort of “fan favorite” in yoga due to its accessibility and calming power. All you have to do is kneel and sit on your knees with them spread slightly apart. Then, lean forward, reach your arms in front of you on the floor and lower your head. “It gently relaxes the pelvic floor and calms the mind, helping reduce tension and stress ― both essential for a satisfying sex life,” Larson said. Larson recommends trying diaphragmatic breathing in a seated position as part of your stretching routine. Sit down (ideally on a chair) and relax your head, neck and shoulders. Then place one hand on your upper chest and the other beneath your rib cage so that you can feel your diaphragm move as you breathe in and out. Inhale slowly through your nose, letting the air fill your abdomen, and then tighten those muscles, letting your stomach move back in as you exhale through your mouth. “It focuses on relaxing and strengthening the pelvic floor,” Larson said. “Proper breathing improves pelvic awareness, which can lead to better control and heightened sensation.” “The prone frog is a deep hip opener that stretches the inner thighs and promotes flexibility in the hips,” Larson said. “This stretch increases range of motion, which can enhance comfort during intimacy.” For a prone frog, you get on all fours and then spread your bent knees out wider. Rest on your forearms with your palms together or on the ground and shift your hips back. Inhale and exhale deeply. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "Adding some eye-catching candles or candlesticks to your dining table or living room is a quick and easy way to elevate your space and add some ambiance. Yet, when something is going to actually disappear the more you use it, it can be hard to justify shelling out tons of money that will literally go up in flames. If you’ve been drooling over super chic candles from shops like Hay, Design Within Reach or even the MoMA Design Store, but are looking for something a little more budget-friendly, we found some incredibly chic lookalikes at some incredibly good-looking prices. Whether you’re hosting a holiday party or just sprucing up a weeknight dinner, you’ll be happy to have a few sets of good looking candles and candlesticks around. If you have little ones or pets or just don’t like open flames in your home, we found some great-looking battery-powered options as well. (Note that paraffin wax, which is widely used in affordable candles, can have deleterious effects on both your personal health and the environment, so we’ve included these options only sparingly.) We hope some of these colorful options set your heart aflame and help to bring some festive and fun energy into your home.

    "text": "The Sugar Bowl College Football Playoff quarterfinal game, set to take place at the Superdome in New Orleans Wednesday night, has been postponed following the deadly terror attack in the city earlier in the day. New Orleans Councilman Joe Giarrusso told WVUE the game will be postponed 24 hours amid concurrent needs to increase security, investigate the attack, and ensure public safety at the high-profile game. The Sugar Bowl Committee confirmed the decision and later announced the game would be held at 3 p.m. CT Thursday. The game between the University of Georgia and the University of Notre Dame had been set to kick off at 7:45 p.m. CT Wednesday night. The Sugar Bowl Committee said in a statement earlier Wednesday that it was “devastated by the terrible events” and offered “thoughts and prayers” for the victims and their families. A University of Georgia student was critically injured in the attack and is receiving medial treatment, according to university President Jere W. Morehead. “I have spoken to the student’s family and shared my concern, support and well wishes on behalf of the entire UGA community,” Morehead said in a statement.

    "title": "This Tabitha Brown Collab Will Make Your Kitchen The Coolest Room In The House",
    "text": "We’ve written and raved about Tabitha Brown before — about her circuitous path to success as an actress, entrepreneur, restaurateur, award-winning television host, best-selling cookbook author, vegan advocate, and social media mogul affectionately dubbed “America’s Mom”; and, most recently, about her namesake Target line, an appropriately category-spanning collection of everything from homegoods and apparel to vegan food and pet supplies that’s been a sellout success since its launch in 2022. While everything in the Tabitha Brown for Target line is worth adding to your cart, her kitchenware is definitely a stand-out. Brown is all about spreading positivity and wellbeing, so it’s no surprise that her’s both in spades: Jewel-colored lidded mixing bowls made of durable, dishwasher-safe, BPA-free melamine; gold-toned measuring cups with beautifully bright handles; in heat-resistant silicone; a stainless steel stovetop tea kettle in eye-catching lavender. Rounding out the good vibes is the price: The majority of items are under $30 (two stoneware baking dishes for $25, a funky bento boxe for $10, a bright berry keeper for $5), while the collection’s most expensive items — a two-tone digital air fryer and a cast iron braiser in Le Creuset-esque teal — are just $70 each. And we’ve just scratched the surface — there’s plenty more to love. Read on for some of our other favorite pieces, and get ready to make the kitchen the coolest room in your house. Is there a prettier way to pack your lunch? We don’t think so. This two-piece set has three separate compartments and a 5-cup total capacity. It also comes with its own fork and spoon. The eye catching colors and scalloped edges adorning this melamine set make it hard to not turn every snack sesh into a full on occasion. When you're done, the bowls nest together for space-saving storage. These thoroughly modernist stoneware shakers will give your dining table an instant upgrade. Wash your veggies, drain your pasta, or just gaze lovingly at this bright yellow colander. The patterned interior and swooped edge are the cherry on top. Why flip your pancakes with a boring black spatula when you can use a two-tone flamingo-pink one? Same question applies to the other equally colorful utensils in this 4-piece set, all of which are made of dishwasher safe silicone and heat resistant up to 420 degrees. These beaded-edge and brightly colored stoneware bowls hold approximately 2.5 cups, perfect for cereal, soup, and other moderately-portioned dishes. Complete your colorful crockery set with these appetizer plates. Like the coordinating bowls above, they’re also made of dishwasher-safe stoneware. These jewel-toned baking sheets are so pretty even your burnt cookies will look good. They’re made of aluminized steel, and come in three different sizes. This avocado-shaped and avocado-colored mug is fun on its own. If you’re a tea drinker, the avocado-on-a-string tea infuser makes it even better. These melamine snack bowls have an angled bottom edge so they tip towards you — without falling over. They’re basically begging you to eat from them.

    "title": "I Spent Over $6,000 At Target Last Year. Here’s Why I’m Giving Up My Favorite Place To Shop.",
    "text": "Goodbye, Spot. Farewell, Circle bonuses. And you, Drive Up, I’ll miss you most of all. Target-loving thoughts zip through my head faster than a runaway red cart as my finger hovers over the bullseye icon on my phone screen. Do I uninstall the Target shopping app or keep it? I’ve been overthinking my Target spending since last week when the company’s memo to employees about the conclusion of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts made headlines in the national news and my hometown newspaper, The Minnesota Star Tribune. The reversal of Target’s commitment to supporting social justice advancements hurts, especially because I’ve always thought of Target as a liberal-friendly business. Target earned my loyalty in 2020 when it made contactless shopping hassle-free, kept masks in stock during the COVID-19 pandemic and increased diversity efforts after the George Floyd protests. Mindfulness is a big reason I’m so attached to my Target app — mindfulness on Target’s part for recognizing big corporations’ role in helping right some of history’s wrongs, and mindfulness for me, too. Shopping in the app and picking up my orders in the parking lot helps me stick to my shopping list and not get distracted by attractive end caps and impulse aisle goods. However, when I read that Twin Cities Pride — the organization that puts on Minneapolis’s biggest queer celebration — disinvited Target from this year’s festivities, I knew it was time to consider deleting the Target app and effectively ending my most significant retail relationship. But my finger hesitates. My mom-of-three lifestyle depends on Target runs. Keeping the app would mean I could still click a week’s worth of groceries or a seasonal school wardrobe into my virtual cart. Then, I could drive to the nearest Target, where a friendly red-shirted employee would load my purchases into the back of my minivan. I scroll through my purchase history to take a look at what I’d miss: the LEGO Advent Calendars, the Cat & Jack joggers and, crucially, the Market Pantry Cheese-Filled Breadsticks, a frozen, ultra-processed staple of my family’s weekly meal plan that I can’t find at any local grocer. I add up my 2024 Drive Up purchases. The total? $6,270.73. On its face, $6,270.73 looks extravagant, but it actually represents mainly practical purchases, like groceries, apparel and school supplies for my family of five — household essentials like lawn care bags and toilet paper. Target’s attempt to compete with Sephora even lets me buy fancy skincare and sunscreen along with kitchen sponges and sympathy cards. Last year, Target helped me sell my home and buy a new one. I shopped at the retailer for moving supplies and home staging decor, as well as all of the extension cords and carbon monoxide alarms required in the new house. I’m a tried and true Target loyalist. So, can I seriously give it all up, this core part of my identity and routine? The #11 Drive Up spot at Edina Super Target is my happy place. I shop at Target the way my middle-aged parent peers abuse Amazon Prime or Costco memberships. I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Target’s corporate headquarters employs enough of my neighbors and casual acquaintances that I’ve been able to pretzel my cognitive dissonance about big box shopping into convincing myself that my weekly Target run is supporting the local economy, a close-but-not-quite equivalent to patronizing locally owned small businesses. But I can’t keep clicking groceries, toys, books, mittens and sports bras into my cart, knowing that the corporation is walking in step with the craven and cruel policies of the new Trump Administration. Target’s employee memo cited “the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape.” They didn’t admit their capitulation, but I can read the context clues. They’re dropping their emphasis on diversity measures just when diverse people need mainstream support more than ever. What does Target’s doing away with diversity efforts really help? Their bottom line? Not only do I not want to associate with the clientele I think Target is now trying to cultivate, but I can’t help but imagine some worst-case scenarios, many of which are already playing out. As trans people are having their identities erased by our government and cruel (and likely illegal) roundups of immigrants are taking place, how can I justify my continued use of the Circle App? Because it’s convenient? Then again, it’s just groceries. And clothes. And Clinique SPF. I’m making this into a big deal because nothing else I’ve tried in the name of resistance has worked. I’ve voted, donated money to progressive causes and political campaigns, and volunteered for Get Out the Vote door knocks. I’ve even held fundraisers for Democratic politicians in my own backyard. And, for all of my efforts, nothing’s turned out the way I want. So, it’s time for me to hurt the diversity dumpers by denying them my domestic dollars. Before I make my final decision, I check in with friends on social media. Lots of leftie folks I know are going to stop shopping at Target, too. My thread fills up with suggestions for alternative places to buy household goods: diversity-embracing Costco is a favorite, and so are all of the Twin Cities grocery chains that employ union workers. Lots of folks are going to shop small and local at businesses that do champion DEI (or at least aren’t actively disavowing it). Maybe my $6,270.73 means nothing to Target CEO Brian Cornell and the rest of the company’s leadership team. But it buys an awful lot of household essential items for my family, the people I love most in this world, people who will lose out if more corporations buckle under Trump pressure. It may be a small thing, but many small actions can make a big impact. In this tenuous time, I’m determined to live my values, and if that means that I have to sacrifice my personal convenience and give up the chemical tang of those Market Pantry breadsticks, then I’ll do it.

    "title": "This Therapist Has Her Clients Ask Themselves 3 Basic Questions Each Morning. It's Changed Their Lives.",
    "text": "Life is challenging for most of us. From relationships, bills and bosses to whatever’s happening in the world at any given moment, it seems like there’s always plenty to be worried about. One of the worst parts of anxiety is not knowing exactly what we’re feeling or how we feel about it — much less what to do about it. But asking ourselves three questions the moment we wake up could have a huge impact on our moods, how we approach our days, and the trajectory of our lives. That’s what we learned when we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast —recently chatted with Dr. Esther Boykin, a Washington, D.C.-based psychologist who focuses on creating healthy relationships. Listen to the full episode by pressing play: Our conversation focused mostly on forgiveness: what it is, how to do it better, when not to do it, and much more. But Boykin also explained that she’s seen her clients make incredible progress in many parts of their lives when they start the day by checking in with themselves. “I like to [tell people to] do it before you get out of bed,” Boykin said. “Take three deep breaths, and then [ask yourself], ‘How do I really feel today? What do I need today? How can I be more tender or gentle with myself today?’ — in that order, because figuring out how you really feel will inform the answers to the next two questions.” By spending just a few minutes thinking about the answers to those questions, we can “pave the path to making it much easier to work on self-forgiveness,” Boykin said. It might seem simple, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy — especially because many of us spend very little time considering ourselves or our lives in this way. “I had a really bad morning and I was walking to the subway with Benji, my boyfriend, and our dog, and [Benji] was asking me about my day,” Michelson said. “And the more we talked, the more I was just like, ‘I’m in a horrible mood.’ And I had to start thinking about, ‘How do I feel?’ And then, ‘Why do I feel this way?’ And I started to unpack it, and I was like, ‘Oh, there’s this thing I’m thinking about and I’m worried about this,’ and I started to triangulate my life and understand my mood.” “It is three simple questions, but they’re actually pretty radical,” Michelson noted. “I don’t think a lot of people actually really think, ‘How do I feel right now? How am I feeling this morning?’ ... Starting there is such a radical place to start.” Once we’ve identified how we feel and what we need, we can start figuring out how to be kinder to ourselves. “There’s obviously, like, forgiveness in the traditional sense, but also forgiveness for ourselves,” Michelson said. “Maybe it’s just kind of saying, ‘I understand why I feel this way, and I’m not going be quite so hard on myself about it.’” “So, maybe you’re not actively forgiving yourself for something,” he went on, “but you’re just... being more tender, being more gentle, and giving yourself a little more credit, a little more slack.” Spending three to five minutes identifying how you feel, why, and what you want to do about it — without blaming or lashing out at yourself — can make a major difference in your life. “I really try very hard to practice it daily myself, in large part because I see how it changes things for people,” Boykin said. “Any of us as therapists, we talk about, like, ‘How do you do the work? How do you sit with your feelings?’ The honest answers tend to be very broad and ambiguous, and it’s hard to wrap your hands around [it], but I’m like ― just these three couple of things, really, there’s this internal shift that happens over time.” “I’ve had clients come back and just be like, ‘I just did it because you said it was like homework,’” Boykin continued. “[And] six months later, they’re like, ‘I just show up for my life differently.’” We also chatted with Boykin about when having empathy can actually be a bad thing, why forgiving someone isn’t always the best idea, and much more.

    "title": "The 1 Sign You're A Little Too Addicted To TikTok",
    "text": "I’ll say it: The power TikTok has on my nighttime routine is unmatched. After I’ve popped a melatonin, brushed my teeth and settled under the covers, I’m heading to the app for funny videos and relatable content. Whether or not TikTok is here to stay is up in the air, although it’s increasingly looking like a ban might take effect in the coming days. But until then, I think it’s safe to say I’m one of many users who enjoys the platform. From recipes and beauty trends to mood-boosting hacks and products that are actually useful, dare I say that TikTok is low-key a lifestyle hub? As with anything, though, too much of a good thing is... well, not a good thing. At what point can endless scrolling be unhelpful, or even harmful? At what point can TikTok use point toward addiction, affect work and relationships, and even cause a sour mood? Ahead, therapists and counselors who specialize in addiction share a major sign you’re addicted to TikTok, why TikTok is so addicting and what to do if your usage causes problems. Addiction experts agree that one sign stands out: Your use of the app takes over your life. “The biggest red flag is when TikTok starts to interfere with daily responsibilities or relationships,” said Michael Villarreal, the CEO of Tres Vistas Recovery, an addiction treatment center in California. “If someone finds themselves skipping work tasks, ignoring family or friends, or struggling to keep up with school or chores because they’re too wrapped up in endless scrolling, that’s a strong sign that their usage has become very unhealthy.” That comes down to one thing. “As with any addiction, the main indicator of a problem is lack of control,” said Beth Chippendale Katona, a licensed clinical professional counselor and a licensed clinical addiction counselor with Thriveworks in Kansas City, Missouri. “The individual experiences consequences and is not able to curb the behavior.” It’s important to note that people experiencing addiction may feel like they’re in control, but that’s not necessarily the case. If all of that sounds a little too familiar, you’re far from the only one. Villarreal shared an example from his practice. “I once worked with a client who realized her sleep patterns were entirely off because she’d get caught up in the ‘just one more video’ loop until 3 a.m.,” he recalled. Addiction and unhealthy usage can present themselves in other noteworthy ways, too. Providers urge people to look out for the following signs. Whether you’re taking a break at work, going to the bathroom or fighting the need to get out of bed, an urge to watch TikTok may arise — and that’s not necessarily a great thing. “If TikTok is the first thing you think about in the morning and the last thing before bed, or if you’re constantly replaying videos in your head during other activities, that’s a sign your brain is hyper-focused on it,” Villarreal said. Feeling anxious, bored or irritable without TikTok, or relying on it for validation, are other signs of dependency, according to Villarreal. Claire Wilson, a therapist with Kelley Counseling & Wellness, also pointed this out. “There can be abrupt shifts in mood when access to TikTok is restricted,” she said. “One may notice a tendency to frequently incorporate TikTok into discussions with others, leading to comparisons with individuals featured on the platform, which can adversely impact one’s mood and mental well-being.” Yep, spending too much time on TikTok can even cause physical problems, unfortunately. “Spending hours glued to your phone can lead to physical issues like eye strain, headaches or neck pain — what some jokingly call ’tech neck,’” Villarreal said. Loving TikTok isn’t necessarily an addiction, so at what point is it? According to Wilson, it’s when “dependency may distort one’s understanding of reality, resulting in a loss of personal identity, alterations in personality, decreased self-esteem and even suicidal thoughts.” Katona summarized her take with three key words: level of impact. When your work, school, relationships and goals suffer greatly because of TikTok, she said, you may be looking at an addiction. “In essence, an unhealthy relationship is problematic but can usually be addressed with intentional changes, while addiction is more compulsive and often requires outside help or intervention,” she explained. So why is it so dang easy to get lost in the sauce of TikTok? How are silly videos so engaging that they can cause real damage? “TikTok is brilliantly designed to keep you hooked,” Villarreal said. “It’s like a slot machine: You don’t know what’s coming next, but you’re sure it’ll be entertaining, so you keep scrolling.” Besides the way it provides endless entertainment and excitement, TikTok’s formulation is also strategic. Katona spoke to the algorithm tailoring content for you, the stress relief it provides and how it can help you feel connected to others in a more comfortable, easy way. Wilson added that the dopamine high is “similar to a high one can get from a drug” and can even “lead to withdrawal symptoms and the onset of addiction, escalating to more serious forms of dependency.” “Comprehending the functionality of TikTok and its impact on users is essential,” Wilson said. “Acknowledging a potential addiction to TikTok is a crucial first step.” The same holds true for other social media apps. Consider the following expert-backed tips: Since the “just one more video” mindset can be a slippery slope (been there, done that), try to set specific, firm boundaries around how much time you want to spend on the app. For example, maybe an hour spread out over the day, or only when you’re in line at the store. Certain tools can make this easier. Villarreal mentioned TikTok’s built-in screen time settings, which Apple phones typically have, too. Villarreal suggested dedicating certain spaces — like your bedroom or the dinner table — as tech-free areas. “This helps you reconnect with life outside the screen,” he said. What else do you like to do in your downtime? That may be an easier, more enjoyable way to replace screen time. Examples of activities Villarreal mentioned include reading, walking and other hobbies. Maybe it’s time to finally meet that reading goal or even bring back the hot girl walk. Feel a compulsion to get on the app? Ask yourself why. “Are you bored, stressed or avoiding something?” Villarreal asked. “Address the root feeling instead of escaping into the app.” For example, maybe you’re trying to avoid an uncomfortable feeling that’s better addressed, at least long-term, in therapy. Or maybe you’re bored and realize pursuing another weeknight activity would fulfill you more. You’re not alone in this journey. Besides having settings and goals to help keep you accountable, you can also talk to someone. “If you’re struggling to cut back, talk to someone, maybe a trusted friend, therapist or support group,” Villarreal said. “There’s no shame in reaching out for help.” Looking for a therapist who specializes in addiction or practices cognitive behavioral therapy may be especially fruitful. CBT is a type of therapy that looks at a person’s thoughts and how they affect mood and behavior. “This method aids in restructuring cognitive patterns and unlearning detrimental habits, while also equipping individuals with coping strategies and alternatives,” Wilson explained. Group therapy may also be advantageous, she added. For example, users may benefit from a Media Addicts Anonymous group, which is similar to the more commonly known Alcoholics Anonymous. TL;DR? “It’s normal to enjoy social media, but the distinction lies in impact,” Villarreal said. “Unhealthy use becomes a full-blown addiction when it starts significantly disrupting someone’s mental, emotional or physical health.” At that point or earlier, these suggestions may be needed for truly happier living.

Dominic Holland, Tom’s father, revealed the happy tidings on his Patreon, according to People, and offered a few entertaining insights into his son’s meticulous preparation for the big moment. In the post, the elder Holland joked that his subscribers were likely more interested in the details of his son’s engagement than the usual updates. “Tom, as you know by now, was very incredibly well-prepared,” Holland’s father wrote, per People. According to his father, the “Spider Man” star secured a ring, got permission from Zendaya’s father to marry her, and was well-versed in every aspect of the proposal, down to “when, where, how, what to say, what to wear.” While the “Avengers” actor’s father did share mild concerns about the couple’s shared visibility in Hollywood, he expressed that he is “completely confident” that the couple will make for a “successful union.” TMZ first reported news of the engagement on Jan. 6 — one day after Zendaya appeared on the Golden Globes red carpet with a ring, setting the internet abuzz.

    "title": "Trump Has Made Me Terrified For My Trans Son's Life, But There's 1 Thing I Won't Do To Save Him",
    "text": "In my favorite picture from my boys’ childhood, my older son is leaning over and straightening his younger brother’s tie, while his brother stands with a look of perplexed surrender on his face. It’s so typical of both of them, especially my oldest. He’s helpful, a little bossy, always looking out for his younger brother, and always directing our fashion choices. He was a thoughtful, kind child who grew into a thoughtful, kind young man. Now his life is in danger. I woke up in a sweaty panic at 2:30 a.m. on Jan. 29, hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order limiting gender-affirming care for children and teenagers under 19 ― one of several executive orders he has signed that take aim at transgender and nonbinary people. He’s coming for trans adults next, I thought. He’s going to criminalize being trans. I poked at this thought the way one pokes at a sore tooth with their tongue, following it into the most frightening corners of my mind. I imagined death camps. I imagined trans people being dragged from their homes, their loved ones, their lives. I imagined others doing nothing to stop it. I couldn’t turn off my brain. In those breathless moments, what I couldn’t imagine was how to keep my trans son, now 22, safe — at least not in a way that allowed us to still be a family. Where can he go? I asked myself, mapping out escape routes in my mind. Who can we ask to hide him? I made a mental list of names, refusing to risk a paper or electronic trail, thinking of places and people who would welcome him, keep him safe, hold him until I could again. I let my imagination roam this dark path until my heart almost broke with a vision of what might come to pass. What I didn’t think of — not until much later, after my panic had run its course and I remembered to breathe again — was what my son would want. It’s sobering to know that I can’t force him to do what I think would keep him safe, and that to try to do so would undermine the very strength that being trans has given him, and rob him of his hard-won, fulfilling life. My son is a fighter — a survivor. He’s had to be, starting at a very young age when he discovered that his sex assigned at birth and his gender identity didn’t match. He fought to understand himself, and then to be understood by others. He fought to be affirmed and respected and treated with dignity. Were I to suggest that the safest life for him is in the shadows, I wouldn’t be honoring any of that, even if my desire can be understood as the desperate love of a frightened parent. There’s much to love about my son. He’s kind. He’s a leader. He has a wicked sense of humor and a wonderful streak of mischief. He looks out for others and he’s way cooler than any offspring of mine has a right to be. He throws himself into new things and loves with his whole heart. Most importantly, he loves himself. If Republicans had their way, he would hate himself into not existing anymore. They’ve stated outright that “transgenderism must be eradicated from public life,” and that they want to end “woke gender ideology.” According to the Trevor Project, LGBTQ+ youth are more than four times as likely as their peers to attempt suicide — not because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, but because of bullying, harassment, lack of support, and ingesting messages that their very existence is up for debate. For my son to love himself in spite of all that is one of the greatest miracles in my life. It’s a strange and terrible thing to recognize that my fiercest desire — for my son to survive whatever Trump and his goons have in store for trans people — has the potential to harm him in the same way. I don’t want him to have to hide who he is, avoid connection and community, or sacrifice his future. That’s what living as his authentic self was supposed to prevent. I want him to live his life out loud, be as visible as he wants, and experience joy and love unabashedly. I will do anything to save my son’s life, but I won’t ask him to live a life as anyone other than who he really is. And I know that’s exactly what he wants for himself — and for everyone. I’ve read that having a child is like having your heart walk around outside your body, and I agree. However, having a trans child is like having other people shoot arrows at that heart on a daily basis. I want nothing more than to shield him from those arrows — throw myself between them and him — but there are so. Damn. Many. Trans people need allies to shield them from the arrows. They need support. They need community. Their lives can seem very small in the face of a constant barrage of hate, of being told they shouldn’t exist, of being scapegoated by politicians who want you to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain because they’re robbing you blind and taking away your rights and selling your safety to our enemies and handing unlimited power to billionaires. None of what’s going wrong in the country today has anything to do with trans people. But they’re being made to shoulder an outsize blame so you won’t notice that you’re a frog in a pot of water that’s getting very, very hot. So what can we do? We can call our elected officials and tell them they need to protect trans people. We can learn more about trans experiences and lives. We can speak up when friends or family members say transphobic things or repeat anti-trans misinformation. If we see a trans person being targeted — whether it’s in a public restroom, on the bus, or anywhere else — we can step in and try to defuse the situation. We can donate to organizations that are working tirelessly to protect trans rights. We can tell the trans people in our lives that we care about them, and ask them how we can best help. We can refrain from openly talking about individuals’ identities — even if they’re out to us — in order to help keep them safe. I remember when my son went to his first Pride parade with his school’s Gender and Sexuality Alliance. I dropped him off at the meeting place and watched him join his peers. Suddenly, I felt certain that he was not so much walking away from me as he was walking toward something wonderful — something he would share with me once it was fully in his grasp. I search for that feeling today, reaching down beneath the news and the noise and the hate. It’s hazy, flimsy, but it’s there. All I can do is remember to breathe and let my son lead me. I’m ready to help do whatever it takes to save his proud, beautiful life. Grace Finch is the pseudonym of a passionate activist, ally, and parent.

    "title": "The Bishop Facing Trump's Fury Has Challenged Him Before. Here's What She Said Last Time.",
    "text": "Editor’s note: The following piece was originally written by Mariann Edgar Budde, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., in August 2020, after she went viral for condemning Donald Trump’s photo op with a bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church. I’ve been thinking all summer about the power of decisive moments ― those times in our lives when we actively choose a particular path or way of being in the world, one that requires us to be brave. We all want to be brave when it counts, to be one who steps up, leans in, does the right thing when it matters most. While the more dramatic of those moments can catch us by surprise, in the sense that we may not have woken up that morning knowing such courage would be required of us, looking at those moments through the wider lens of time, we realize that they are not isolated events. A decisive moment ― one that we remember as having marked or defined us ― is often preceded by a long season of preparation. And when the moment passes and the adrenaline rush is over, we are left to live according to what we felt at the moment of decision. Serving as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington requires me to step into the public arena on occasion ― never enough for some members of the capital region diocese and far too often for others who prefer their bishops to keep politics out of church and church out of politics. Truth be told, more often than not when I speak or act publicly, few people outside of church circles notice or care. But every once in a while it happens that the world takes notice, as it did on June 1 when President Donald Trump made his now-infamous walk across Lafayette Square, with top military and Cabinet leaders at his side, in order to be photographed holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church. Moments before, standing before journalists in the Rose Garden, the president had threatened to use military force against American citizens who had joined a protest ― one of many taking place around the world ― in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. The order was then given to forcibly remove all protestors from Lafayette Square and the courtyard in front of St. John’s Church, presumably to clear a path for the president. “I managed to get in front of a microphone that evening to say that the president had no right to the spiritual mantle he had attempted to claim as authority for his actions and words.” Urged on by horrified church colleagues who were watching this scene unfold live and immediately contacted me, I managed to get in front of a microphone that evening to say that the president had no right to the spiritual mantle he had attempted to claim as authority for his actions and words. As it turned out, the microphones and cameras kept coming for about four days, and I kept saying essentially the same thing. It seemed to others that I was being very brave. Maybe I was, but in all truth, it felt more like being summoned to speak on behalf of others who were being brave, others in the church and the nation who were standing up for racial equity, others in the church and the nation were outraged by what they saw. I did my best to embrace the moment without losing sight of the larger struggle for racial justice that people across our country were demanding. It was a bit like riding a wave. Like all waves, it was all-consuming for a brief moment and then ― and here’s the point ― the moment passed. And I’m not persuaded that it was all that decisive a moment for me, at least not in comparison to other dramatic moments of that very dramatic week. Keep in mind the larger truth that for Black and brown people in the United States, there was nothing new in the way George Floyd died. People of color have been killed at the hands of law enforcement and vigilante citizens since the founding of this country. What is new is the ability for ordinary citizens to record on video what generally happens in secret. What is new is that the long protest by people of color has been joined, at last, with a rising sense of horror and shame among white Americans. The veil on our eyes has been lifted, a moment amplified and intensified by the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing murderous racial disparities in this country that we white Americans had refused, until now, to see. For me, the more important decisive moment came the following Sunday. I was back on what’s now called Black Lives Matter Plaza, listening to the words of Bishop William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign. Bishop Barber looked out on the wonderfully multiracial, intergenerational crowd gathered and said, “Do not let anyone tell you that this is the first time people of different races, classes and educational backgrounds have come together to fight for a common cause. It has always been such a coalition of the faithful that has brought about change in this country ― Black, white and brown; rich and poor; young and old. Everyone is needed; everyone has a part to play and an offering to make.” When he said that, I felt shame and performance anxiety roll off my shoulders and I heard myself say to God and to the universe, “I want to be among the coalition of the faithful now. I want to be among those working for the change we need now.” That’s the decision that informs my life today. It’s not exactly a new decision, but I feel it in a new way. It won’t always burn in my heart the way it does now, I know that. But I pray for the grace and courage and perseverance to be true to it even when the passion of this season fades. “Threshold” is a word we’re using quite a bit in this country ― I’ve used it myself ― to describe where we are, a kind of crossing over from one reality to the next. “Crucible” is another, to connote the possibility of transformation when elements come together under pressure and heat. We find ourselves wanting to be brave, to do right, to act with courage, and we must, but given the challenges before us and our fallibility as human beings, it’s important to acknowledge that as we step up to the plate, we’ll miss more balls than we hit. “For when that decisive moment comes in the midst of a whirlwind and we feel called to act ― to be truly brave ― we do so trusting less in ourselves than in the power, the energy, the spirit that’s compelling us forward.” But here is a surprising truth: Acceptance of our imperfect perceptions, incomplete understandings, our woefully inadequate actions and rather small place in the scheme of things is paradoxically and wonderfully empowering. For when that decisive moment comes in the midst of a whirlwind and we feel called to act ― to be truly brave ― we do so trusting less in ourselves than in the power, the energy, the spirit that’s compelling us forward. We don’t have to be perfect, which is a good thing, because we won’t be. We don’t have to take on the entire world, only our corner of it. We’ll never know the ultimate significance of our words and actions. We simply don’t know. “But what a relief it can be to accept contingency,” writes the poet Christian Wiman, “to meet God right here in the havoc of change.” The truth is that we don’t yet know if this will be the time, whether we, as a nation, are ready and willing to make the kinds of changes we so desperately need. We don’t know now whether our efforts will bear fruit. But what we do know ― what I know ― is this: Wherever we are in the continuum of change, there are ways to be faithful to that vision, to be part of the coalition of the faithful. Whether this is the turning point or yet another season of preparation, whether we are successful today or whether we fail, we can do what God asks of us, which is our part ― faithfully, imperfectly, in an ever-changing world in which we, too, are being changed.

    "title": "Energy Production At A Record High, But Trump Declaring An ‘Emergency’ Anyway",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — American energy production hit all-time maximums under just-departed President Joe Biden, but that is not stopping his successor from declaring an “energy emergency” to increase oil drilling. “We will drill, baby, drill,” President Donald Trump said in his inaugural speech in the U.S. Capitol. “We have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it ― we’ll use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top and export American energy all over the world.” Trump, who promised during his campaign to cut gasoline and electricity costs by at least half in his first year in office, Monday night signed an order that directs federal agencies to “identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them” to hasten energy development and transportation, including by weakening processes put in place to protect the environment and endangered species. A separate order makes available vast areas of Alaska for oil and gas drilling. How much Trump’s new actions will increase domestic oil production is unclear. Because oil is traded on a global market, Trump will need the world’s largest producers in the OPEC cartel to go along with his plan and not undermine it by cutting production as the U.S. increases production, as they have done in the past. “He will have to seek foreign influence from OPEC to bring down prices, and I think that is a situation that will escalate because they will resist and he will threaten them,” said Matt Randolph, an oil industry executive with more than three decades of experience in the business. “I can’t imagine anything in an ‘energy emergency’ executive order that would actually increase energy production,” he added. “Opening land that was closed that nobody ever drilled on, speeding up permits that aren’t going to be used for years anyway, none of it adds up to oil and gas being pulled out of the ground. It’s most likely all performative.” U.S. production of oil entered a steady decline from November 1970 until the dawn of Barack Obama’s presidency in November 2008. Thanks to the advent of a new drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the U.S. petroleum output roughly doubled from 5 million barrels per day to just under 10 million barrels by Obama’s last year in office. Following a brief dip at the start of Trump’s first term, production once again soared to about 13 million barrels per day before the COVID-19 pandemic ground the economy to a halt. With cars and factories idled, demand for oil plummeted and prices briefly fell into negative territory, forcing the booming oil fields in Texas and North Dakota to cut production. Under former President Joe Biden, oil boomed once again. Last summer, U.S. production soared past Trump’s record level and continued climbing through the November election.

Bush’s second term. “Instead of addressing the real emergency of the climate crisis, like the ongoing fires in California, Trump’s plan to declare an energy emergency is another attempt to boost the profits of his fossil fuel donors rather than help the American people,” Elizabeth Bast, the executive director of the anti-fossil fuel climate group Oil Change International, said in a statement Monday. “United States production of oil and gas is already at a record high, while American jobs in oil and gas have declined and global demand for fossil fuels is expected to peak in the next five years.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Trump Revokes Workplace Discrimination Rules Enacted By LBJ In 1965",
    "text": "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he had revoked a six-decade-old executive order designed to combat workplace discrimination and promote affirmative action among federal contractors, undoing a labor standard that stretches back to the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson. The rule Trump nuked, Executive Order 11246, forbade federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity. It granted the Labor Department the power to enforce its provisions through a contracting standards office. The order was part of a long history of the federal government using contracting rules to try to root out discrimination. Signed a year after the Civil Rights Act was passed, it explicitly required that employers who accept federal contract money take “affirmative action” not to discriminate against job applicants or workers. In a statement Wednesday, Trump attacked it as “radical DEI preferencing,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion. DEI programs, which aim to improve workplace conditions and reduce hiring disparities for minorities, have grown into a conservative obsession and major policy target for Trump and his allies, who often say DEI enables “reverse” discrimination instead. The regulations Trump revoked included “placement goals,” or targets for employers to meet in the hiring of underrepresented groups. Moving forward, Trump said, the Labor Department would be forbidden from “pushing contractors to balance their workforce based on race, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, or religion.” He called his order rolling back the 60-year-old protections “the most important federal civil rights measure in decades.” As of Wednesday afternoon, the Labor Department’s webpage still described Johnson’s executive order as a “historic step towards equal employment opportunity” and said it “remains a major safeguard” for millions of workers. “Signed by President Johnson that early autumn Friday in 1965, Executive Order 11246 became a key landmark in a series of federal actions aimed at ending racial, religious and ethnic discrimination, an effort that dated back to the anxious days before the U.S. was thrust into World War II,” the site reads. Democrats and advocacy groups were quick to criticize the move. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Trump’s order would “gut core civil rights protections” as well as the Labor Department office that enforces them.

Judy Conti, government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group, said Trump had stripped away a “key tool” in combating discrimination. “This is not a return to so-called ‘meritocracy,’” Conti said in a statement. “Rather, it’s an attempted return to the days when people of color, women, and other marginalized people lacked the tools to ensure that they were evaluated on their merits.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Trump Offers Buyouts To All Federal Workers",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it is offering buyouts to all federal employees who opt to leave their jobs by next week — an unprecedented move to shrink the U.S. government at breakneck speed. A memo from the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, also said it would begin subjecting all federal employees to “enhanced standards of suitability and conduct” and ominously warned of future downsizing. The email sent to millions of employees said those who leave their posts voluntarily will receive about eight months of salary, but they have to choose to do so by Feb. 6. President Donald Trump has built a political career around promising to disrupt Washington, and vowed that his second administration would go far further in shaking up traditional political norms than his first did. Still, the repercussions of so many government workers being invited to leave their jobs were difficult to calculate. Katie Miller, who serves on an advisory board to the Department of Government Efficiency, a special Trump administration department headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and tasked with shrinking the size of government, posted on X, “This email is being sent to more than TWO MILLION federal employees.” The federal government employed more than 3 million people as of November last year, which accounted for nearly 1.9% of the nation’s entire civilian workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. The average tenure for a federal employee is nearly 12 years, according to a Pew analysis of data from OPM. Even a fraction of the workforce accepting buyouts could send shockwaves through the economy and trigger widespread disruptions throughout society as a whole, triggering wide-ranging — and as yet unknowable — implications for the delivery, timeliness and effectiveness of federal services across the nation. Untold numbers of front-line health workers in the Veterans Affairs Department, officials who process loans for homebuyers or small businesses, and contractors who help procure the next generation of military weaponry could all head for the exits at once. It could also mean losing experienced food inspectors and scientists who test the water supply — while disrupting everything from air travel and consumer product protections. In response, American Federation of Government Employees union President Everett Kelley said it should not be viewed as voluntary buyouts, but pressuring workers not considered loyal to the new administration to vacate their jobs. “Purging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,” Kelley said in a statement. “Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration’s goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.” In its emailed memo detailing its plan, OPM lists four directives that it says Trump is mandating for the federal workforce going forward — including that most workers return to their offices full-time. “The substantial majority of federal employees who have been working remotely since Covid will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week,” it reads. That echoes Trump, who said of federal employees over the weekend: “You have to go to your office and work. Otherwise you’re not going to have a job.” The memo also says Trump “will insist on excellence at every level,” and while some parts of the government’s workforce may increase under his administration, “The majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized.” Finally, it says, the ”federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work.” “Employees will be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward,” the memo reads. The emailed message includes a “deferred resignation letter” for federal employees to begin leaving their posts. “If you resign under this program, you will retain all pay and benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in-person work requirements until September 30,” it says. The email even includes instructions on how to accept, stating: “If you wish to resign: Select ‘Reply’ to this email. You must reply from your government account.” It adds: “Type the word ‘Resign’ into the body of this email and hit ‘send.’” Meanwhile, OPM has released guidance for an executive order Trump signed on the first day of his second term known as “Schedule Career/Policy.” It replaces Schedule F, an order Trump signed late in his first term that sought to reclassify thousands of federal employees and make them political appointees without the same job security protections. President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s Schedule F order almost immediately upon taking office in 2021, and under his administration, OPM issued a new rule last year designed to make it more difficult to fire many federal employees. That move was seen as a safeguard against using a new Schedule F order to help carry out the key goals of Project 2025, a sweeping plan by a conservative Washington think tank to dismiss large swaths of the federal workforce in favor of more conservative alternatives while also cutting back on the overall size of government. But that hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from swiftly moving to gut the federal workforce and leave employees with little recourse to protest firings or reassignments. Trump’s OPM on Monday set deadlines for agencies to begin to recommend workers for reclassification. Agency heads are being instructed to establish a contact person no later than Wednesday and begin to submit interim personnel recommendations within 90 days. “Agencies are encouraged to submit recommendations on a rolling basis before this date,” Charles Ezell, the acting director of OPM, said in a memo. Perhaps more stunning, the Trump personnel office simply did away with the Biden administration’s 2024 regulation to better protect federal workers. Monday’s memo said Trump’s new executive order used the president’s authority “to directly nullify these regulations.” ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Lisa Mascaro in Washington and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.

    "title": "Trump Loses It Over Flags Flying Half-Staff At His Inauguration",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump went on a social media rant Friday over American flags being flown at half-staff during his inauguration, both complaining about the situation and blasting his opponents for laughing about it. “The Democrats are all ‘giddy’ about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at ‘half mast’ during my Inauguration,” Trump wrote. “They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves.” He continued: “Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it.” In recognition of the life of late Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who died earlier this week at age 100, President Joe Biden issued a proclamation ordering U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and other government locations “for a period of 30 days from the day of his death.” The proclamation is in line with a policy from the United States Department of Veteran Affairs. That means flags will be flown at half-staff through Jan. 28 ― more than a week after Trump’s scheduled inauguration at the U.S. Capitol. The twist of fate has fueled social media fodder in recent days, with jokes about Carter leaving “one last gift” for Trump and the half-staff flags signifying not just the death of Carter, but also the death of democracy. Trump also suggested multiple times throughout his post that the half-staff flags during his inauguration were only a possibility. “Let’s see how it plays out,” he wrote. He also wrongly asserted Friday that the flags would be flown at half-staff “for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President.” In 1972, President Richard Nixon took the oath of office while flags were flown at half-staff in memoriam of President Harry Truman.

At a rally days before November’s election, he fumed over technical issues with his mic. “You’ve got to be kidding. Do you want to see me knock the hell out of people backstage?” he said, adding later: “I get so angry. I’m up here seething. I’m seething. I’m working my ass off with this stupid mic. I’m blowing out my left arm. Now I’m going to blow out my right arm and I’m blowing out my damn throat, too, because these stupid people.” He’s also gotten worked up about a malfunctioning teleprompter, not looking “slim” in photos, having to walk down stairs at his events and jurors not smiling at him during his hush money trial.

    "title": "Trump’s Funding Freeze Put Critical Services For Millions In Jeopardy",
    "text": "When President Donald Trump ordered an across-the-board freeze on all grants, loans and federal financial assistance on Monday, it threw nonprofits that provide services to millions of Americans into a state of chaos and fear. Federal funding for everything from health care, disability care, veteran’s care, housing, special education, substance abuse support, after-school care, food assistance and more flows to thousands of nonprofits across the country every week. All of a sudden, that funding stopped, threatening to throw people onto the streets, out of jobs and deprive them of much-needed services that allow them to live their fullest lives. Meals on Wheels, the program providing food assistance to the elderly, feared it wouldn’t be able to deliver food. Preschool operators who receive Head Start funding thought their kids would no longer have a place to go. Small nonprofits with little outside funding and limited reserve funds faced the prospect of immediate closure. This fear even extended to Easterseals, a more than 100-year-old nonprofit that provides a gamut of services to the disabled, children, the elderly and veterans. Easterseals’ experience is illustrative of the chaos Trump’s freeze created on Tuesday and the vast damage to society it could wreak if it were to go into full effect. “Everything that we do would have been impacted,” said Donna Davidson, the president of Easterseals North Georgia. Easterseals was originally founded in 1919 as the National Society for Crippled Children to provide services and advocate for the disabled. The success of its “Easter Seals” fundraising campaign, which had donors put the organization’s seals on letters, led the nonprofit to eventually adopt that name in 1967. Today, Easterseals provides services to 1.5 million people through 70 affiliates in nearly every state. Most of the group’s funding comes from federal and state grants and financial assistance programs. All of that was put at risk on Tuesday when the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo seeming to freeze all grants, loans and financial assistance distributed by the federal government as part of a policy to implement Trump’s executive orders combating “Marxist equity, transgenderism and the green new deal.” That memo was rescinded on Wednesday after a wave of controversy and a federal judge imposing a temporary restraining order on the freeze, although the administration still says the underlying policy is in place. Judge Loren AliKhan’s order blocking the freeze runs until Feb. 3 when she will hear further arguments on whether or not to extend the restraining order or not. In the meantime, it appears that some agencies are blocking funding from going to grantees. At 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Davidson received a phone call informing her that the payment portal her organization uses to draw down money through federal programs, specifically Medicaid and Head Start, was down. There had been no warning and no message as to what was going on. “We had no information,” Davidson said. “That was the most difficult thing for us.” The portal had gone dark after Trump’s budget office issued a vague memo ordering a freeze for all grants, loans and financial assistance across the federal government. Easterseals North Georgia is one such grant recipient, receiving funding through the portal on an as-needed basis to pay a staff of 400 people and for their programs servicing disabled people, seniors, veterans and 1800 children and their families. The organization needs to draw down funds on Tuesday to meet payroll on Friday. But the system was shuttered. “We didn’t have any funds to pay our employees,” Davidson said. “What that means for us is, [if] this was going to continue, we would have to immediately close.” The potential consequences were stark. Without the federal payment portals they use to cover their expenses, Easterseals’ national office and local affiliates faced the prospect of simply not being able to provide services. “I hate to use the word catastrophic, but the ripple effects could have been catastrophic,” said Tracy Garner, president of Easterseals Louisiana. One program under Garner’s chapter provides housing to 500 disabled Louisianans who otherwise faced homelessness. The portal to access that urgent funding, provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, had gone down. If the funding freeze continued, these 500 people would be left without homes. “Many of those individuals have underlying or co-occurring behavioral health and oftentimes intellectual and developmental disabilities,” Garner said. “This critical funding keeps Louisiana citizens from being un- or under-housed. Any halt or reduction would really set our state back literally years. The amount of homelessness would spike immediately.” Further north in Georgia, Davidson was concerned about Easterseals’ Head Start-funded programs that serve thousands of children in Atlanta and Northeast Georgia. Head Start funding does not come from just one source, but through a variety of federal agencies and grants: The Child and Adult Care Food Program provides meals. Medicaid provides speech and autism therapy. The Department of Education provides funding for early childhood intervention for disabled infants and toddlers. Absent federal funding, Easterseals’ programs would cease to operate, leaving thousands of children without the services they need while forcing parents to quit their jobs. “Seventy-five percent of our families work, many in positions that are hourly,” Davidson said. “If they don’t have our program and had to pay for child care, it would be so expensive that they couldn’t continue to work.” Davidson convened a meeting on Tuesday to discuss what the organization would be able to do if the payment portal remained shuttered. Who could they pay? What services would be shuttered? She began to draw up contingency plans. But one thing became clear. “We would have had to close our doors if this continued,” Davidson said. “All of those families and children would go without those much-needed services.” In Louisiana, Garner spent Tuesday “scrambling” to obtain any information to provide to her staff who were “fearful for their jobs” and to people she serves afraid of losing support. The national Easterseals office was hit by the OMB memo, too, as it administers a program funded by grants from the Department of Labor to help seniors transition back into the workforce for 10 affiliates. “The chaos that memo created forced us to start to talk about layoffs,” Kendra Davenport, Easterseals CEO, said. “It was a terrible, terrible day of chaos and utter confusion.” By 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Davidson was finally able to access the federal payment portal. The Trump White House had begun a major walkback of the OMB memo. The initial memo had been extremely vague. It called for a freeze on all grants, loans and federal financial assistance, but specifically said that this did not apply to Medicare and Social Security. In a second memo issued late Tuesday afternoon, OMB stated that the original order was not meant to apply to assistance that goes directly to individuals. But this is equally vague. Medicaid, for example, is not paid directly to individuals. It goes to states, which then disburse payments to individuals, health care providers, hospitals and nonprofits. Medicaid also partially pays the salaries for the professional speech therapists, autism specialists and behavioral and mental health therapists that Easterseals employs to help the disabled people the organization serves. Does that assistance go directly to individuals? The same goes for Head Start. That program is funded through multiple grants and goes to nonprofits and other institutions to provide services to individuals. Is that going directly to individuals? “It’s been very confusing,” Davenport said. “How we interpret it is that Medicaid to individuals was not going to be touched, but Medicaid to organizations was going to be touched. None of this is clear. The memos coming out on an hourly basis only add to the confusion.” The administration added to the confusion on Wednesday when OMB rescinded the original memo, but the White House stated that the policy outlined in the memo remained in place. A federal judge had already issued an injunction blocking the memo from being implemented on Tuesday, and a second judge followed suit on Wednesday after the memo was rescinded. Nonprofits like Easterseals are now left in a state of limbo. The funding freeze is now like Schrodinger’s cat — is it alive or is it dead? Nobody knows. That question looms over all the work that the nonprofit does for the disabled, elderly, children and veterans. Instead of going about their normal business, Easterseals’ leaders had to divert their attention to draw up contingency plans to determine “what we are going to shut down and where,” Davidson said, in case the order came back into effect. “The chaos has only just begun,” Davenport said. “Yes, these grants being frozen again would impact us in a terrifically bad way.” Davenport, Davidson and Garner hope that there is a lesson for the public, and maybe the administration, to be learned from this about the importance of these federally funded services.

    "title": "Don’t Believe The Spin: Trump Isn’t Prioritizing Criminals For Arrest Or Deportation",
    "text": "President Donald Trump has made a political career out of vilifying immigrants, from claiming in racist attacks they have “bad genes” to falsely accusing them of committing more crimes than Americans who were born here. Trump spent much of the campaign talking about ridding the nation of “criminal” undocumented people. But when it comes to immigration enforcement, the Trump administration hasn’t actually focused very narrowly on people with criminal records. Data from around the country indicates that many people arrested or deported by federal agents under Trump don’t have any serious criminal history at all, let alone any record that would raise fears about public safety. On the Sunday following Trump’s inauguration, for example, immigration agents arrested 1,179 people — but 48% of them had no criminal history at all, apart from potentially crossing the border without authorization, NBC News reported based on an unnamed government source. On Tuesday, out of 200 people sent to Colombia on two deportation flights, none were criminals, Colombian officials said. In fact, officials said the deportees on the flights included more than 20 children and two pregnant women, the Washington Post reported. The same day, federal agents in New York arrested 20 people in a highly-publicized operation across the city. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem donned body armor and posted on social media about removing “dirtbags” from “our streets.” But, the Post reported, eight of the 20 people ultimately taken into custody in that action had no criminal record at all. One video published by DHS Monday stated that in the week prior, immigration officials had “removed and returned 7,300 illegal aliens, including hundreds of convicted criminals.” The implication, observed journalist Aura Bogado, was that thousands of people in that group of deportees did not have criminal convictions at all. Two Trump administration policies underscore this apparent lack of focus on undocumented people with criminal records. Prior to Trump’s first term, then-President Barack Obama instructed immigration authorities to “prioritize” the deportation of undocumented people considered national security threats, those with serious criminal records, and those who’d recently received removal orders. Trump erased all that when he assumed office, putting in place a much broader set of priorities and making it an administration policy that no one would be exempt from deportation. In 2021, then-President Joe Biden instituted enforcement priorities of his own — similar to Obama’s — and then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas emphasized prosecutorial discretion, noting that, “the majority of undocumented noncitizens who could be subject to removal have been contributing members of our communities for years.” Taking office last week, Trump reversed Biden’s priorities, “resetting” immigration enforcement policy and encouraging immigration authorities to execute immigration laws against “all inadmissible and removable aliens.” “When you don’t have enforcement priorities, everyone is subject to detention,” Rosanna Eugenio, legal director at the New York Immigration Coalition, told NBC News. The second reason for the lack of focus on people with criminal records is the Trump administration’s emphasis on raw numbers. Trump campaigned on a “mass deportation” agenda, and said in his inaugural address that he would “begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.” At her first press conference Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked how many ICE arrestees had criminal records versus those simply in the country without authorization. She rejected the premise of the question outright. “All of them, because they illegally broke our nation’s laws,” she said. Contrary to Leavitt’s characterization, simply overstaying a visa is a civil, not criminal, offense. Crossing the border without authorization is a misdemeanor the first time. And being deported isn’t a criminal punishment. Undocumented people can and do serve criminal prison sentences just like American citizens. “Two things can be true at the same time,” Leavitt added, explaining that though drug dealers, rapists and murderers “should be the priority of ICE,” no one was “off the table.” ICE field offices around the country have been instructed to hit a quota of 75 arrests per day — a figure that Trump adviser Stephen Miller has called a “floor, not a ceiling.” And the administration has tasked the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and U.S. Marshals with pitching in. In practice, this means immigration enforcement will focus on who is easiest to arrest – not who poses the most danger to the American public. That includes undocumented people who go to ICE offices around the country for regularly scheduled check-ins with immigration agents – appointments that can turn into surprise detentions and deportations. “Quotas will incentivize ICE officers to arrest the easiest people to arrest, rather than the people that are dangerous noncitizens,” Paul Hunker, former ICE chief counsel in Dallas, told the Post, which broke the news about the field office quotas. “Challenging enforcement actions take time and planning and careful execution,” Deborah Fleischaker, a former senior official at ICE and DHS, including during the first Trump administration, told The New Republic. “And if they’re being required to arrest more and more, whether that’s a quota or not, they can’t take that time that those arrests require. And so, yes, it will ultimately lead people to stop focusing on those and focus on the places where they can get bigger numbers faster.” Across the country, local news reports suggest immigration officers might try to get their numbers up with relatively straightforward arrests – people who are wearing ankle bracelets, for example, or those involved in the criminal justice system for extremely minor offenses. In Tucker, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta, Wilson Rogelio Velásquez Cruz was arrested by immigration agents after his ankle bracelet — which he was given by border agents after arriving at the border years ago — started ringing during a church service on Sunday. His wife, Kenia Colindres, told him to go outside and address the ankle bracelet so as to not disrupt the service, she told WSBTV. ICE agents were waiting. Colindres told 11Alive that her husband had a valid work permit and a pending asylum case, and had not been detained by law enforcement since arriving at the southern border in 2022. In Texas, Jose Alvaro, a 29-year-old father, was detained by ICE agents after a routine traffic stop while he and his family were on the way to buy baby formula. Alvaro was in the process of applying for a green card. He has no apparent criminal record, The Texas Tribune reported. In Lynn, Massachusetts, one 18-year-old girl was detained by ICE after police were called when she quarreled with her little brother over a cell phone, resulting in a misdemeanor assault and battery charge. “We have been told that ICE would be targeting violent offenders whose presence puts our community at risk,” Lynn Mayor Jared Nicholson told MassLive. “Based on what we have learned so far, that is not what is happening in this case.” Reports have also emerged of Puerto Ricans and Native Americans — U.S. citizens — being stopped and detained by ICE, potentially the result of racial profiling. There’s one more key detail for understanding Trump’s immigration enforcement priorities: Just because someone is arrested by immigration agents doesn’t mean they’ll be deported. While some categories of undocumented people are able to be deported quickly, such as those whose cases have already been heard by immigration courts or who qualify for “expedited removal,” most are not. In the meantime, undocumented people who encounter immigration agents either have to be held in federal custody — and there aren’t that many beds across the entire country for immigration detention — or they must be released, and will be required to show up to an immigration office for regular check-ins. And ICE only has funding to detain around 42,000 people, including through contracts with private prison companies and local governments. Almost all of those beds were already occupied when Biden left office. “Unless someone shows me data to the contrary, many of these people arrested will be released from custody in a relatively short period of time,” observed Austin Kocher, a professor of geography at Syracuse University who studies immigration enforcement. “They are not all staying in detention.” Kocher added in an email to HuffPost, “Unless they fall under a mandatory detention classification, ICE does not currently have the bed space to indefinitely detain everyone they are arresting.” We’ve already seen what happens when an indiscriminate immigration enforcement policy runs up against limited bed space in federal immigration detention: It raises the risk of releasing more people with criminal records from detention. In October last year, the Cato Institute crunched the numbers, finding in a report that “In 2019, Trump’s ICE released more than twice the number of individuals convicted of crimes compared to any year during Biden’s presidency.” That year, the report found, “ICE was using 68 percent of its detention space for individuals without any criminal convictions.” According to the same report, “a big pre-pandemic reason for the releases under the Trump administration was that it was determined to detain as many asylum seekers as possible, prioritizing their detention and removal over that of convicted criminals.” David Bier, the report’s author and Cato’s director of immigration studies, told HuffPost that similar dynamics could play out in Trump’s second term. “Right now, it seems like they’re just trying to arrest anybody they can, put up numbers, and send a message, or put the media blitz on it,” Bier said. “I expect that they will be releasing convicted criminals and public safety threats,” he added. “I suspect that they already are, and they’re just not telling anyone.” One confounding variable is Trump’s efforts to create more space for immigrants to be detained. He recently announced he would pursue the use of Guantanamo Bay as a detention center — apparently catching Pentagon officials by surprise, and raising concerns about denial of access to legal representation for undocumented people on the base, among a slew of other issues. U.S. Northern Command also recently announced that Buckley Space Force Base, in Aurora, Colorado, had been approved to “enable [ICE] to stage and process criminal aliens within the US for an operation taking place in Colorado.” Those actions could potentially create tens of thousands more beds to be used for detaining undocumented people pending deportation.

Another open question: How dramatically the Laken Riley Act, which mandates the detention of undocumented people for mere allegations of criminal activity — including something as innocuous as alleged shoplifting — will increase the population of detained undocumented people. Trump recently signed the bill, which received bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, into law. One widely-reported memo drafted by ICE officials during the Biden administration noted that the bill’s detention requirements went beyond ICE’s current capabilities. “If supplemental funding is not received and ICE remains at its current bed capacity, the agency would not have the detention capacity to accommodate the immediate arrest and detention of noncitizens convicted or charged with property crimes. [ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations] anticipates that tens of thousands of noncitizens would need to be released by the end of the fiscal year, resulting in the potential release of public safety threats.” The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment.

    "title": "Trump’s Jan. 6 Pardons Complete The Rewriting Of His Coup Attempt",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Donald Trump incurred no legal consequences for his Jan. 6, 2021, attempted coup, and now members of his mob who assaulted police officers in his name that day will no longer be held accountable, either. Within hours of swearing to protect and defend the Constitution in his oath of office, Trump on Monday freed from federal prison hundreds of his followers who had been convicted of beating, kicking, punching, bear-spraying and otherwise attacking police officers to help him remain in power, despite having lost reelection — what authoritarian experts describe as a “self-coup.” “Authoritarianism is the conversion of rule of law into rule by the lawless. He needs the people with those skill sets on his side,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University. Added Boston College historian Heather Cox Richardson: “He is sending a signal that he will take care of anyone who will fight for him.” As Trump signed an order granting the mass release, he repeated falsehoods about the Jan. 6 criminals — who by their actions meet the definition of domestic terrorists ― that he and his allies have been spreading for three years, including that prosecutors were imprisoning an elderly grandmother merely for protesting. He continued to lie to reporters about Jan. 6 in the White House Tuesday, even claiming that some jurisdictions in this country do not prosecute murderers, while maintaining that his supporters had been punished too harshly. “They’ve served years in jail and their lives have been ruined,” he said, and then added that he thought that the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia groups — members of which have been convicted of violence or seditious conspiracy ― were actually great patriots. “These were people who actually love their country.” In fact, the vast majority of protesters who merely trespassed that day and did not engage in violence were not charged with felonies and did not receive jail time. A HuffPost analysis of sentencings of the Jan. 6 defendants tracked by The Prosecution Project found that the median sentence for 534 nonviolent offenders whose cases had been completed was zero time behind bars, and that the average sentence was 4.3 months. In contrast, the median sentence for 319 defendants convicted of violent offenses was 30 months in prison, with an average of 38 months. They included Trump supporters like Andrew Taake, who received 74 months at a federal prison in Beaumont, Texas, for pepper-spraying police officers and hitting one with a metal whip. And Christopher Alberts, who got 84 months in the federal prison in Milan, Michigan, for carrying a loaded 9mm pistol onto Capitol grounds and hitting police officers with a wooden pallet. And Steven Cappuccio, who got 85 months in the federal prison in Forrest City, Arkansas, after beating an officer with such ferocity, including with the officer’s own baton, that he held his cellphone in his mouth so he could use both of his hands. All three, and hundreds more, won their freedom with full pardons, meaning they will have all their rights restored, including the right to own firearms. Trump also released from prison 14 members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, but used commutations, not pardons, so their criminal records will not be expunged. How many precisely are to be freed is unclear. The Bureau of Prisons, now under Trump’s control, did not respond to a HuffPost query. However, the Department of Justice earlier this month reported that about 600 individuals had been charged with assaulting or impeding a police officer, and a database created and maintained by NPR showed 418 cases of assault and violence. Trump White House aides did not respond to HuffPost queries asking why Trump released violent criminals who attacked police officers, a group that Trump claims to support. The comprehensive pardons contradicted assurances from Vice President JD Vance, who on Jan. 12 told Fox News: “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.” Trump himself suggested the same in interviews before the November election when he said those who “were out of control” on Jan. 6 or who were “radical, crazy” would not get pardons. Amanda Carpenter, a former Republican aide in the Senate who is now with the Protect Democracy nonprofit, said that his release of those willing to attack police officers and commit other violence on his behalf should not have been surprising, given that Trump repeatedly honored them at his rallies. “He’s been signaling he’s going to do this since he started his 2024 campaign,” she said. Trump could have issued a blanket pardon for all the eventual Jan. 6 offenders in the two-week span between Jan. 6 and the day he left the White House for his South Florida country club. At the time, though, he was focused on avoiding potential criminal charges against himself, as well as a Senate conviction on his impeachment for inciting the attack. Had enough GOP senators joined with Democratic colleagues, they could have banned Trump from federal office forever. Instead, Trump read a speech, prepared with input from White House lawyers, in which he scolded the insurrectionists and promised that they would be prosecuted. “To those who broke the law, you will pay,” he said. His own lawyers claimed during his impeachment trial in the Senate that Trump did not approve of what happened. “He, like the rest of the Country, was horrified at the violence,” they wrote in a Feb. 8, 2021 brief. While the House impeached Trump on a bipartisan vote, not enough Senate Republicans voted with Democrats to convict Trump with the necessary two-thirds majority. Within weeks, Trump was back to claiming that the 2020 election was stolen from him — a lie he continues to repeat to this day. Later in 2021, Tucker Carlson, at the time Fox News’ top rated primetime host, produced a lie-filled series that claimed the FBI had staged the Jan. 6 attack as a “false flag.” Trump subsequently began claiming that his followers had done nothing wrong that day and were “hostages” and “political prisoners.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Trump read the Pledge of Allegiance aloud and his words were interspliced with the inmates’ singing. A Just Security analysis of the jail roster that day found that 17 out of the 20 were either charged with or had already been convicted of assaulting a police officer. By the time he had won the GOP nomination in spring 2024, most elected Republicans had already bought into the propaganda version of Jan. 6. Trump’s release of those ready to engage in violence to do his bidding was merely the closing chapter, Carpenter and other democracy advocates said. “Pardoning the Jan. 6 rioters was his first and most important campaign promise,” she said. “What this does is create a license of more political violence in the future.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Judge Denies Trump Request To Stop Sentencing",
    "text": "Donald Trump will not be able to stop his sentencing hearing on Friday, according to the judge who oversaw the president-elect’s criminal hush money case. In an order issued Monday, Judge Juan Merchan said Trump’s request to delay the hearing was unsuccessful because it is a “repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past.” Merchan has already indicated he would not sentence the incoming president to prison time for his 34-count felony conviction, lawyers for Trump now want to nix the sentencing hearing while an appeal is underway. When he is sentenced, he will formally be considered a convicted felon. He will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Trump’s attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, said they intend to formally file their appeal Monday and that they will contest two previous rulings from the judge that rejected bids to dismiss the case on immunity grounds. In a request filed in New York on Sunday, the attorneys argued that the Constitution and protections already afforded to Trump under the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling last year mean there can be no sentencing while he actively appeals. In a dig at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Blanche and Bove wrote Monday that the case should be dismissed and the sentencing immediately halted because the entire matter was “flawed from the very beginning, [and] centered around the wrongful actions and false claims of a disgraced, disbarred serial-liar attorney” eager to violate Trump’s due process rights. Bragg filed a motion opposing Trump’s request on Monday. The trial ended over seven months ago, Bragg wrote, and all post-trial motions have been adjudicated. As for sentencing, the district attorney urged that “the Court has already stated its intent to impose the lowest possible sentence authorized by law: an unconditional discharge.” “There is no risk here of an ‘extended proceeding’ that impairs the discharge of defendant’s official duties — duties he does not possess before January 20, 2025,” Bragg wrote. Further, Trump’s conduct underpinning the charges has been disputed at length, and it was determined already that it was not official. “And, until his inauguration on January 20, 2025, defendant is simply not engaged in any official presidential functions that would support a claim of immunity from ordinary criminal process. Because the charges on which defendant was convicted are wholly unrelated to his official conduct, and because defendant relies on a purported ‘President-elect’ immunity doctrine that does not exist, his invocation of immunity does not entitle him to an automatic stay pending appeal,” Bragg wrote. When New York Judge Juan Merchan issued a ruling on Dec. 16 flatly rejecting Trump’s presidential immunity arguments as grounds for dismissal, he explained his reasoning: The evidence presented and used to convict Trump related “entirely to unofficial conduct,” and the Supreme Court had left the door open to prosecution for unofficial acts. In May, a jury found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an alleged tryst he had with adult film actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trial evidence and testimony from Trump’s onetime fixer and attorney, Michael Cohen, demonstrated how Cohen helped coordinate the cover-up of a $130,000 payment for Daniels that was meant to keep the news from spilling out into the public. Even after his conviction, Trump has continued to claim he is not guilty. When Merchan refused to dismiss the case in December, he wrote that falsifying business records “poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the executive branch.” In his order for Trump to appear at sentencing, the judge said Trump should be permitted to “avail himself of every available appeal,” but the sentencing hearing would move ahead nonetheless. The only “viable” course forward would be to issue a sentence under the terms of “unconditional discharge,” Merchan wrote. This type of sentence, which imposes no fines or prison time, is rare, but when applied, it is typically because there is no practical punishment available. Trump’s lawyers asked for a response from the judge by 2 p.m. on Monday. If there is none, his lawyers said they will file a request for an emergency appellate review. In addition to vacating the sentencing hearing scheduled to take place this week, they have also asked that all further deadlines in the case be “fully and finally resolved.” Trump was meant to be sentenced in the criminal hush money case in July. That sentencing hearing was waylaid by Merchan multiple times. He postponed sentencing so the Supreme Court could consider his immunity arguments and then again because of demands from Trump’s presidential campaign. When reached for comment Monday, a spokesperson for Trump called the case a “witch hunt,” as Trump has done with any legal matter in which he is a defendant. “The American People elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate that demands an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and all of the remaining Witch Hunts. We look forward to uniting our country in the new administration as President Trump makes America great again,” spokesman Steven Cheung said.

    "title": "Trump Throws Out Policies Limiting Arrests Of Migrants At Sensitive Locations Like Schools, Churches",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Officers enforcing immigration laws will now be able to arrest migrants at sensitive locations like schools and churches after the Trump administration threw out policies limiting where those arrests could happen. The move announced Tuesday reverses guidance that for over a decade has restricted two key federal immigration agencies — Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — from carrying out immigration enforcement in sensitive locations. “This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens — including murderers and rapists — who have illegally come into our country. Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Tuesday. The ICE guidance dates back to 2011. Customs and Border Protection issued similar guidance in 2013. Trump has made cracking down on immigration a top priority, just as he did during his first term in the White House from 2017 to 2021. On Monday he signed a slew of executive actions that included cutting off access to an app that facilitated the entry of hundreds of thousands of migrants; suspending the refugee system; and promoting greater cooperation between ICE and local and state governments. He has often portrayed his efforts as unleashing the ability of ICE agents and others in immigration enforcement from Biden-era guidelines that he said restricted their efforts to find and remove people who no longer have the authority to remain in the country. The announcement Tuesday had been expected as Trump works to deliver on his campaign promise to carry out mass deportations of anyone in the country illegally. But it was still jarring for advocates who have argued that raising the prospect of deportation at churches, schools or hospitals can prevent migrants from getting medical attention or allowing their children to attend school. “This action could have devastating consequences for immigrant families and their children, including U.S. citizen children, deterring them from receiving medical attention, seeking out disaster relief, attending school, and carrying out everyday activities,” the Center for Law and Social Policy said in a statement.

    "title": "Trump Posts Brutal Spoof Of His Viral Chat With Obama At Jimmy Carter’s Funeral",
    "text": "Donald Trump has mocked the viral video of him chatting with Barack Obama during former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral last week. On Sunday, Trump, who like Obama has not revealed the details of their conversation, posted a spoof of their talk complete with fake audio from the moment that sent social media users down a rabbit hole of speculation. “I knew you’d win,” a dubbed Obama said while seated next to Trump. A pseudo Trump responded, “Come on. Anyone could beat her,” referring to Vice President Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 presidential election. After Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, sat down in the row in front of Trump and Obama, the faux Obama then asks Trump, “Did you see that? [Harris] won’t even look at me,” prompting simulated Trump to reply, “I was told [by] some of her people, apparently they said she fell off the wagon.” “I think she actually may have…and also she’s not really built for this amount of pressure,” fake Obama added. Elsewhere in the clip, in which Trump didn’t include a caption, the pair’s mock conversation took aim at President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “He just didn’t wanna leave,” the forged audio from Obama said of Biden. “I did what I could to help [Harris]. She was horrendous.” “You know what I realized? Hillary still hates me,” phony Trump added. “So much.” On Thursday, Trump admitted to reporters that he “didn’t realize how friendly” the pair’s moment at Carter’s funeral looked after reporters asked him about what they discussed during a presser at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “I said, ‘Boy, they look like two people that like each other.’ And we probably do. [Me and Obama] have a little different philosophies, right? But we probably do. I don’t know,” Trump said. He added, “We just got along. But I got along with just about everybody. We met backstage, as you know, before we went on. And I thought it was a beautiful service.

    "title": "Ukraine Switches From Russian To U.S. Gas",
    "text": "The new year is bringing a seismic shift for war-torn Ukraine’s energy systems. Even as Russia’s military rained missiles down on Ukrainian cities, Moscow’s state-owned gas giant, Gazprom, has earned billions selling fuel to Europe via Ukraine’s Soviet-era pipeline network. But Russia’s invasion made negotiating a renewal deal with Kyiv impossible, and Gazprom’s five-year contract to transit gas through Ukraine expired on New Year’s Day. So this month, Ukraine is getting a new gas supplier: the United States. The first shipment of American gas into Ukraine marks a milestone in Washington’s bid to replace Russia as Europe’s top source of the fuel most used for heating and electricity. Analysts say the delivery — just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, and amid what is forecast to be a particularly cold winter — offers a direct appeal to an American leader who campaigned on expanding U.S. exports of natural gas but whose Republican Party is split on whether to continue military support for Kyiv. “The historic significance of this moment can’t be understated,” said Olga Khakova, the deputy director for European energy security at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center. “This provides opportunities for Ukraine to be seen as an energy partner and not just be seen through the lens of being a charity case, which Ukraine is not.” Last April, the U.S. took the top spot as the world’s No. 1 exporter of liquefied natural gas, a version of the fuel that’s been super-chilled to a liquid form to make shipping easier. Two months later, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, announced a deal to start buying LNG from Virginia-based Venture Global, one of the U.S.′ biggest producers. On Dec. 4, a gas tanker carrying 100 million cubic meters of fuel departed Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana. The vessel arrived at a port in Greece on Dec. 27, where special equipment turned the liquefied fuel back into gas that was then pumped into storage containers and the local energy system. Shipping the gas along the patchwork of pipelines connecting Greece to Ukraine would be expensive on top of the already-steep cost of transporting the fuel across the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, most of the gas arriving from Louisiana will end up burned in Greece. On paper, however, DTEK traded that shipment of American fuel for an equivalent supply of gas currently in storage units in Hungary and Bulgaria. That means just some of the physical gas molecules expected to flow into Ukraine sometime in the coming days actually came from the U.S. Most of the gas making its way to Ukraine now came via pipelines from Norway, but some includes LNG shipped to Germany from the U.S. None of the gas originated in Russia, DTEK said. Still, DTEK called the debut delivery a “symbolic” step meant to “test the route, test the mechanics of the deal and test the terminals” before ramping up shipments from the U.S. The company predicted flows would “definitely increase” over the next four years. “The next administration will be even more supportive of the investment into the gas industry, the transportation of gas, and building new LNG production terminals,” Dmytro Sakharuk, the chief executive of DTEK’s commodity trading subsidiary, D.Trading, told HuffPost via a Zoom call from Kyiv last week. “The number of ships and volumes will increase,” he added. “We want to be part of that. We think it’s very important, not just from a commercial point of view but also a political point of view.” For much of the past two decades, Europe has depended on cheap Russian gas shipped westward via pipelines to power its industries, keep homes warm in the winter, and transition away from coal, which typically produces far more lung-damaging and planet-heating pollution than gas when burned. Europe’s largest economy, Germany, increased its reliance on Russian gas even more in 2023, when Berlin shuttered all German nuclear power plants. Before invading Ukraine, Moscow started restricting flows of gas to countries in the U.S.-led NATO alliance. Once the war started, those European nations sought alternatives to Russian gas, sales of which were financing the conflict. And as a fracking boom transformed the U.S. into a top producer of gas and oil, American companies stepped in to fill the gap. Last January, the Biden administration paused federal permitting approvals for new LNG terminals as the Department of Energy completed a study examining the economic and environmental effects of the export boom. But a federal judge in Louisiana overturned the Biden administration’s pause months later, and the Energy Department started approving new permits again in September. While the freeze is still technically being contested in court, Trump vowed on the campaign trail to end the freeze on Day 1 of his next presidency. If planned construction continues U.S. LNG export capacities will have nearly doubled by the time Trump’s next term expires. By 2028, the U.S. will have the capacity to ship 232 billion cubic meters of LNG overseas per year, up from 126 billion today and far ahead of second-place Qatar’s 171 billion. That is enough to meet global demand for LNG for decades to come, according to a long-awaited study from the Energy Department, published last month. Citing that research, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, in trying to defend the LNG pause Biden backed, warned that lifting restrictions on more LNG exports threatened to raise Americans’ energy bills at home and would dangerously increase planet-heating emissions. The analysis “exposes a triple-cost increase to U.S. consumers from increasing LNG exports,” she said in a statement. That includes the “increasing domestic price of the natural gas itself [and] increases in electricity prices,” given that gas is the top source of electricity in many U.S. power markets. American industry would also end up paying $125 billion more for energy, Granholm said, “leading to additional potential price increases for a wide range of consumer goods.” Urging Congress and federal regulators to limit LNG exports, the Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a trade association representing U.S. manufacturers, pointed out how large a share of U.S. gas output is destined for overseas compared to other fossil fuel production. While the U.S. exports just about 10% of its gasoline and less than a quarter of its crude oil, the LNG export facilities already approved today have the capacity to export volumes equal to more than half the net supply of gas produced in the U.S. in the entirety of 2023. “For crude and gasoline, the U.S. has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There is no equivalent for natural gas,” Paul Cicio, the president of IECA, said in a statement. “Consumers are completely exposed.” Ukraine’s bid to become a new distributor of imported American natural gas isn’t just about cementing ties with the U.S. Among the countries most affected by the end of Russian gas shipments through Ukraine’s pipelines are Slovakia and Hungary, who will help decide the fate of Ukraine’s bid to join the European Union and whose leaders have maintained closer relations with Russia than most in the continental bloc. “What the Ukrainians are trying to do is to put themselves in a position to have more leverage over Hungary and Slovakia and potentially make them a little friendlier to the Ukrainian position in this war as we head into negotiations,” said George Beebe, the director of grand strategy at the Washington-based Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. DTEK said its imports “bring new additional volumes into the region that will decrease” the spike in gas prices from the loss of the Russian supply. “If you have enough gas, nobody is nervous about volumes,” said Sakharuk. “That’s why the price stays stable.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

The new supply may do little to ease the burden on Moldova, Europe’s poorest nation and the country most impacted by the halt in Russian pipeline shipments, as HuffPost previously reported. Making Ukraine a major market for U.S. LNG depends first on reaching a settlement of the war, since the local economy can only use so much fuel as the nation’s infrastructure lays in ruin from ongoing fighting, Beebe said. Even then, he said, Ukraine is likely to remain a relatively small import hub compared to ports in Germany and the Baltics, where U.S. tankers are currently offloading fuel. “Could it be politically significant in that Ukraine is sending a signal it wants to align itself with Trump’s priorities in Europe? That helps marginally,” Beebe said. “The Ukrainians are trying to do everything they can to ingratiate themselves with Trump, knowing their future is heavily dependent on decisions the Trump administration makes on policies toward Ukraine and the terms on which the war might get settled.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "United And Delta Flights Have Midair Collision Scare Over Arizona",
    "text": "Two commercial passenger planes had a midair scare Saturday morning over Phoenix after coming dangerously close to contact while preparing to land. Cockpit warnings were triggered within the United Airlines and Delta Air Lines flights as they descended into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport around 11 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. Both planes experienced “a loss of required separation” but landed safely, said the FAA, which is investigating the incident. “Air traffic control issued corrective instructions to both flight crews.” A recording of the air traffic control, obtained by LiveATC.net, captured an automated “descend, descend” in the Delta flight’s cockpit as it prepared to land. Delta’s flight, an Airbus A330-300, was carrying 245 customers from Detroit, while United’s, a Boeing 737-900, had 123 passengers and six crew members from San Francisco, the airlines said. Video taken from the ground by a plane spotter captured the planes buzzing past one another in the sky. “It was immediate panic mode,” Justin Giddens, who shot the video, told Arizona Family. “I know the way the planes are supposed to be in the pattern on approach to Sky Harbor … it was very, very close.” Both planes at one point came within 1,200 feet horizontally from one another and at another point 425 feet vertically, according to flight tracking data from the website Flightradar24. A Delta spokesperson stressed in a statement to HuffPost that nothing is more important than safety. “Delta flight crews extensively train to handle uncommon scenarios such as this and followed the resolution advisory as directed,” they said.

    "title": "Trump’s Immigration Battle Could Cause U.S. Population To Shrink As Migrants Are Targeted",
    "text": "In only eight years, America’s population growth will stop, barring one factor: migration from outside U.S. borders. That’s the finding from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in a little-noticed report released Jan. 13. The CBO, Congress’ in-house budget and economics experts, compiles annual demographic updates as part of its broader work. The latest report found that net immigration — the sum total of American citizens migrating from the country versus the number of people coming in, documented or otherwise — would be the sole source of U.S. population growth beginning in 2033, seven years earlier than according to last year’s projections. “It’s a big deal,” CBO Director Phillip Swagel told reporters Jan. 17. Why is the date at which migrants account for all population growth now expected to arrive so much sooner? Swagel attributed it to a decline in the rate of U.S. women having children. “A change in fertility really has profound effects for the U.S. population and the economy,” he said. “We’re already an aging society. And the aging of our society is driving mandatory outlays, of course. It’s driving Social Security and it’s driving Medicare. And the change of fertility, in some sense, accelerates that pattern, the aging of our society.” Since July 2022, the CBO has steadily moved up the year in which the U.S. becomes dependent on immigration for all of its population growth. In 2022, that year was 2043. In the newest report, it jumped seven years to 2033, the biggest one-year jump since the crossover date began arriving within the 30-year time horizon of the demographic outlook. The finding comes as President Donald Trump has newly inflamed the immigration debate by issuing several executive orders within a day of returning to the White House, with the aim of stopping migrants from arriving at the U.S. border and seeking asylum. He also ordered the Pentagon to help support building a border wall, and to aid in efforts to detain and transport migrants as part of the launch of his promised mass deportations. The CBP One mobile app, which many migrants to the U.S. use for scheduling their immigration court appearances, was also shut down, and Trump signed an executive order challenging birthright citizenship, the language in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution that grants citizenship to most people born within the borders of the U.S. and its territories. Trump’s moves are already being challenged in court by immigration advocates. Trump came to power the first time in part by savaging undocumented migrants during his campaign, and once in office, he imposed harsh measures, such as family separation, to deter migration into the U.S. Yet when Democratic and Republican senators negotiated a compromise migration and border security bill in early 2024, Trump convinced most GOP senators to oppose it. During the 2024 election cycle, Trump was even more strident in his rhetoric, promising mass deportations and accusing migrants of “poisoning the blood” of the country. His new executive order raises the ante for pro-immigration groups. “America has always been and will increasingly continue to be a nation of immigrants. No matter how hard Trump and his allies may try, immigrants aren’t going anywhere,” said Santiago Mayer, executive director of the Gen Z-focused political group Voters of Tomorrow, which advocates for student loan forgiveness, a higher minimum wage, and creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. “It’s past time elected officials recognize the diversity of our generation as a strength and take a stand against Trump’s hatred and xenophobia,” Mayer said. The CBO has bumped up its estimates of net migration into the U.S. in recent years ― reflecting an increase in migration in what the office calls “other foreign nationals,” people who entered the country illegally, or people who are in the U.S. due to immigration parole authority or while awaiting court proceedings. But declining birth rates are what lie at the heart of the current 2033 projection. “Before the financial crisis of 2007, 2008, 2009, fertility in the US was right around replacement [rate] — replacement is 2.1 [births per woman] — and fertility declined during the financial crisis and stayed down and then declined again in the pandemic, and has only rebounded modestly,” Swagel said. The new estimate revised down fertility rates to 1.6 children per female from 1.7, well below the 2.1 rate. The main reason is a change in the age of the mothers who are giving birth — specifically, a decline in teen and young adult pregnancies. The birth rate for teens and women between the ages of 14 and 29 is now almost half of what it was a dozen or so years ago. “There’s some increase in fertility among women just beyond that [age]. But it doesn’t compensate for the lower teen and in 20s [birth rates],” Swagel said. Which women are having children also matters. The CBO report said women born in the U.S. were projected to have a fertility rate of 1.56 in the new update, compared to a rate of 1.88 for women born outside of the U.S. The report, however, also comes as conservative politicians are making a concerted effort to limit access to reproductive choice, including abortion and contraception, within the United States.

    "title": "This 28-Year-Old Woman Is Going Viral For Creating A 'Medical Binder' So Doctors Listen To Her, And It’s Genius",
    "text": "“If I’m trying to talk to you about my knee pain, I’m not reading you my colonoscopy report. That’s not relevant. I’m not reading you my echocardiogram. That’s not relevant,” Wetz said. “OK? Unless you accuse me of never having one and you wanna argue with me.” Wetz said her video has also started discussions about the need for universal online record-keeping systems. “In Canada, for example, healthcare is managed provincially, so each province has different systems (or none at all),” Wetz said. She explained in British Columbia, where she lives, doctors often use several different, disconnected apps, which causes problems like doctors being unable to access records, leading to faxed requests or repeated tests. Wetz also said her reports shifted from saying things like “patient verbally reports receiving a diagnosis” to “she has a diagnosis” based on the evidence in her binder. “I’m taken seriously now, and doctors are aware that their report will go into my binder next, which results in fewer errors,” she said. “Too often, there’s a power imbalance between doctors and patients, and it stems from differences in the amount of information that patients have access to,” Bervell told BuzzFeed. “Jessica’s binder is a tool that can bridge the gap between patients and providers by fostering clearer communication and accountability.” “Often, when patients come to the hospital from different institutions, it can be difficult to find all of the records in one place. Medical binders aren’t just helpful for patients, but helpful for providers as well,” he said. Similarly, Wetz told BuzzFeed that she had to become an “expert record keeper” with her binder and, in some ways, an “amateur AI med student” to get her concerns taken seriously. “In a perfect world, the healthcare system would track these details seamlessly, but given current limitations, particularly fragmentation within electronic medical records, it often falls on the patient. This speaks to a need for better integration of patient records, continuity of care, and a more compassionate approach to patient communication.” Bervell suggested that a practical approach might be to focus on the binder as an objective reference and communicate its purpose. “Focusing on the information that is most useful to doctors (aka pieces of your history that are objective that they may not have access to already, like imaging results, lab values, discharge summaries, etc.) can help forgo this,” he said. She explained, “I told my doctor I needed all my records for a private consultation abroad, and they provided the form. I made 20 photocopies, filled them out, and they faxed them to every facility I visited. Over time, the envelopes and USB drives rolled in, and I only had to pay around $70. I was shocked there were still records from my birth and childhood as well.” “This was obviously tedious and extensive work, which many sick people don’t have the energy for, so please ask for the help of any support you may have,” Wetz told BuzzFeed. “Without it, I don’t think I could have finally gotten the diagnosis and treatments I’ve needed since I was a child.” “You might see inaccurate info between what you remember saying and what’s written or outright lies. Some doctors write their reports immediately, while others might wait a week. There are ways to correct information through official means if you feel it’s inaccurate and affecting your care.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Ramaswamy, who sought the 2024 Republican nomination for president, has signaled plans to run for governor of Ohio. “Vivek Ramaswamy played a critical role in helping us create DOGE,” Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the commission, said in a statement. “He intends to run for elected office soon, which requires him to remain outside of DOGE, based on the structure that we announced today. We thank him immensely for his contributions over the last 2 months and expect him to play a vital role in making America great again.” Ramaswamy, the son of Indian immigrants, made hundreds of millions of dollars at the intersection of hedge funds and pharmaceutical research, a career he charted and built while graduating from Harvard University and then Yale Law School.

    "title": "FYI, You're Probably Walking On Icy Sidewalks All Wrong",
    "text": "An icy sidewalk, driveway or walking trail is a real danger. Roughly 800,000 people who slip and fall each year need medical attention, according to the Mayo Clinic. Even if you don’t end up in the hospital, slipping on ice can still be really painful, resulting in scraped knees, bruised elbows and other ailments. “These falls are quite frequent ... 1 in 5 of them actually end up in an injury that requires care,” said Dr. Kariline Bringe, an orthopedics surgeon at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin. “So, if we eliminate the fall, we’ll eliminate those injuries.” When it comes to eliminating the fall, experts say there is one tip they especially want everyone to know when walking in icy, snowy weather. It may sound funny, but experts say the best way to keep yourself from slipping on the ice is by changing your stride. “It’s called penguin walking because you do kind of look like a penguin while you’re doing this type of walk,” said Monica Leach, a physical therapist and board-certified clinical specialist in geriatric physical therapy at the Cleveland Clinic. Here’s how to do the penguin walk, as explained by Leach: Here are a few videos that demonstrate the walking style. “I think the big key here is slowing down, taking these small shuffling steps,” Bringe said. The reason has a lot to do with friction and gravity. “As it gets icy out there and things get slippery, the larger our steps, the more force you’re coming across. It’s going to increase the likelihood that you slip,” Bringe explained. Conversely, penguin-like steps ― small, slow and shuffled ― are going to decrease your risk of slipping, she said. “If you do slip, you don’t have so much momentum behind it. So you’re less likely to slide a long way,” Bringe said. And with your center of gravity above your feet, it’s less likely that a small slip will turn into a big fall. Another thing that makes this an efficient way of walking is the fact that your hands are free. “Your arms are free and able to come out from your body — that will also help improve your balance and decrease those risks of falls,” Bringe explained. “And, if you do fall, [it] gives you an opportunity to hopefully catch yourself before you bang your head.” Leach emphasized that people need to keep their hands out of their pockets when walking in the snow. You can’t properly walk like a penguin if your hands are shoved in your pockets; it will affect your ability to balance or react if you need to. The same goes for phones. “I think the phone is an... extra piece to falls now, because all of us have our phone in our hand,” Bringe said. “We are checking our email, we’re texting people, we’re not looking at where we’re walking, we’re not examining that surface to make sure that there isn’t ice there... and so putting that phone away when it’s a little more hazardous is probably a good tip as well for avoiding those falls.” “We are so fortunate to have great predictions from our weather teams. We know that these things are coming,” Bringe said. “So, being prepared — you know it’s going to be snowing in two days, get that car filled up, make those trips to the grocery stores so you’re not out unnecessarily ... That makes it safer for you and safer for everybody who needs to be out there.” If you do have to be out in the snow and you require a walker or a cane, make sure you don’t forget your assistive devices at home, Bringe said. Additionally, make sure you’re wearing supportive winter shoes with traction. According to the Mayo Clinic, it’s important to wear shoes or boots that have “deep-grooved, nonskid, rubber treads.” Leach said you should also be extra cognizant of your surroundings. It’s important to look up and make sure nothing is in front of you ― and also to look down from time to time, to make sure you aren’t about to walk on an icy surface. “I’d say all dark, wet areas [are] probably slippery or icy,” Leach noted. “Even if you’re not sure, you might want to avoid those types of areas where you’re walking.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Washington Post Cartoonist Reveals She Quit After Paper Killed Sketch With Bezos, Trump",
    "text": "Washington Post editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes on Friday revealed that she was quitting the newspaper after it rejected a sketch depicting its billionaire owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, on bended knee for Republican President-elect Donald Trump. “I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations—and some differences—about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now,” wrote the Pulitzer Prize winner on the platform Substack. Telnaes — who began working at the Post in 2008 — shared a rough draft of the cartoon, which also depicts Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the character Mickey Mouse — a stand-in for The Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC News. Some of them appear to be holding up bags of money toward a large figure with a long tie and small hands whose face is out of frame — the apparent representation of Trump — while Mickey Mouse is seen bowing to him. Telnaes wrote that the cartoon criticizes those “who have been doing their best to curry favor” with Trump. “To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary,” Telnaes wrote. “That’s a game changer…and dangerous for a free press.” David Shipley, the Post’s editorial page editor, said in a statement to The New York Times that he respects Telnaes and her contributions to the newspaper “but must disagree with her interpretation of events.” “Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force,” he said. “My decision was guided by the fact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column — this one a satire — for publication. The only bias was against repetition.” The cartoonist’s announcement comes after the Post faced backlash over its decision to not endorse a candidate in last year’s presidential election. The paper’s editorial board had reportedly drafted an endorsement of the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, before Bezos reviewed it and the endorsement was scrapped. The Post had regularly endorsed candidates for decades before the move, which led to a drop in subscribers and a number of staff resignations. But Bezos, in remarks last month, said the paper had made the “right decision.” Telnaes, who recently reshared a 2019 visual essay in which she described editorial cartoonists as “democracy’s canary in a coal mine,” wrote that her job as an editorial cartoonist is to “hold powerful people and institutions accountable.” “For the first time, my editor prevented me from doing that critical job,” she wrote. “I doubt my decision will cause much of a stir and that it will be dismissed because I’m just a cartoonist,” she added, before going on to reference a slogan used by the Post. “But I will not stop holding truth to power through my cartooning, because as they say, ‘Democracy dies in darkness’.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "This Aggressive Baby Name Trend Is 'Alarming' Experts",
    "text": "Some parents draw baby name inspiration from sources like family history, geography or even their favorite foods and brands. Others look to literature, music and pop culture. Still others get ideas from a more surprising source: weapons. “There is a small but noticeable trend of parents using weapons-inspired ― and, more broadly, aggressive ― names for their sons,” Sophie Kihm, the editor-in-chief at the website Nameberry, told HuffPost. “Many of these names first appeared on the baby name charts in the 2000s, including Wesson, Caliber, Shooter and Trigger.” Weapon-inspired monikers that parents have chosen in recent years also include Blade and Cannon, as well as brand-related names like Remington, Colt, Ruger and Winchester. Arson, Cutter and Dagger are among the other names with a violent edge in recent data from the Social Security Administration. “Most of these names peaked in use relatively recently — Wesson in 2021 when it was used 306 times, Caliber in 2018 with 24 uses, Mace in 2022 with 64 uses, Dagger in 2022 with 13 uses,” Kihm noted. “It’s hard to say if these names have truly peaked in use or if some will go on to greater use, but I don’t think we’re past this trend yet!” Abby Sandel, the creator of the baby name blog Appellation Mountain, believes the trend will evolve over time. “That initial wave of names borrowed from gun manufacturers has probably peaked, but we’re still hearing plenty of choices in this category,” she said. “The most popular names now are a little more subtle. Archer once referred to a soldier who fought with a bow, but it sounds preppy and polished in 2025. Likewise, Barrett is a sophisticated surname that also happens to be a firearms manufacturer.” According to the experts, various factors are driving this baby name trend. “There’s a certain set of parents that believe weapons-inspired names have a renegade spirit, which has been a rising theme among today’s trendy baby names,” Kihm noted. “Maverick ranks higher than ever, and cowboy-style names like Dutton, Stetson and Boone are climbing the charts.” So, many parents may be thinking of weapon names in the same way as cowboy-related ones. “It’s easy to imagine Boone and Wesson or Shooter and Stetson being brothers,” Kihm said. Another potential influence is that many weapon-related names resemble ― or in fact are ― surnames as well. “‘Last names as first names’ are a stylish category for baby names, with English surnames most likely to be adopted as given names,” Kihm explained. “Popular last names as first names include Carter, Parker and Hunter — itself somewhat aggressive ― which match weapon names like Shooter, Trigger and Dagger, with the two syllables and ‘er’ endings.” Similarly, Wesson sounds a lot like Weston, which has recently ranked among the SSA’s top 100 baby names for boys. For some parents, the appeal of such names may also be tied up in conservative values around gender or guns. BabyNames.com founder Jennifer Moss believes some parents are drawn to weapon names for their sons because they feel “threatened” by recent cultural shifts toward broader acceptance of gender identities and expressions outside the traditional gender binary. “Assigning these overly violent names might be a reaction to the fear that their son might have less-than-masculine traits,” she said. “So these parents assign a dictionary word name that has been traditionally associated with aggression or strength, hoping to instill those characteristics into their male offspring.” “Weapons-inspired names convey masculinity without being traditional male names,” Kihm added. “They are at once undeniably masculine and extremely modern. We associate weapons with men and masculinity, so these parents might have more conservative values around gender.” She pointed to Nameberry’s analysis of “The Reddest and Bluest Baby Names,” which found that parents living in so-called red states are more likely to choose gun-themed names for their children. “In our study, we identified Gunner ― notably spelled with an ‘er,’ which differentiates it from the Scandinavian Gunnar ― as the ninth ‘reddest’ name for boys in the U.S.,” Kihm said. Parents in red states are also known to choose names that evoke romanticized imagery of rural life, which can include farming occupations and weaponry. There’s a general interest in names that signal strength and independence as well. “Some of the most obvious choices are clearly more popular in red states,” Sandel said. “Think Maverick or Walker ― the fictional Texas lawman of television fame. That’s true for weapons-related names, too. You’re more likely to meet a newborn Remington or Gatlin in Texas or Alabama, rather than California or Maryland.” “It’s rare for me to outright reject a name or name trend, but I cannot get behind weapon-inspired names,” Kihm said. “They glamorize violence and, particularly in the wake of so much violence in the U.S., feel out of touch. In name consulting, I’ve never encountered a parent who wants to use these names, but I would advise any client against it.” Moss noted that parents have been using dictionary words as names for their children for centuries, pointing to examples like Faith and Angel, as well as occupation-based picks like Mason and Thatcher. But she emphasized the importance of being cognizant of the meanings of these kinds of names and the public association with them. “I find the weapon names particularly alarming because it’s tying your child to an instrument of destruction or death ― or at the least a word that’s associated with violence,” Moss said. “Another reason not to use a name with an immediately identifiable meaning is that it can become a joke. People’s first response might be to laugh at it, or assume that you do belong to a particular culture that favors weaponry or violence. It comes with baggage.” Not every weapon-related name carries the exact same meaning or weight, however. “It’s just like any other category in naming ― it’s great to honor what we love and value, but the name has to leave space for our child to become their own person,” Sandel said. “So, yes to Remington or Archer. A cautious maybe to Gatlin and Gunner. But Beretta? I think that crosses a line.” Although distinctive names can be great, she noted that Beretta is both uncommon as a given name and immediately recognizable for its association with weapons, lending it an aggressive feel that might be a burden on a child. Still, Sandel added that the weapon trend is consistent with an overall shift in the baby name sphere. After generations of parents sticking to familiar names for their sons while taking a more daring approach for their daughters, there’s finally a little more creativity in the realm of boy names.

Give your child a name that evokes positivity, that will grow with them and they can make their own instead of conforming to your expectations.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "'XO, Kitty' Blends K-Drama Tropes With American Teen Soap Campiness",
    "text": "“After so much K-drama, things could not be more perfect,” Kitty says toward the end of “XO, Kitty” Season 1 before things, of course, implode again in her love life, friendships and high school classes. After all, it’s this never-ending drama that acts as the universal thread, binding Korean dramas and American teen soaps together. “XO, Kitty” is a Netflix spinoff based on the characters that Jenny Han created in her trilogy “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” also adapted into three Netflix movies. The show is about Lara Jean’s youngest sister, Kitty Song-Covey (Anna Cathcart). Unlike those books, which bring K-drama tropes to America, “XO, Kitty” follows the youngest Song sister to Korea where she attends KISS, the Korean International School of Seoul. Just based on the boarding school’s name, it’s obvious that “XO, Kitty” will follow in the footsteps of “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” to tell a story of first loves and growing up with the trademark sincerity that Han has become known for in both “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” and “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” However, unlike its predecessors, “XO, Kitty” incorporates more elements of Korean TV. It’s this blending of K-drama tropes and American teen soap campiness that makes “XO, Kitty” different from other young adult shows. This completely unserious but fresh fusion of genres is also what makes it fun to watch, as does the never-ending drama. That’s why, from the opening minutes of Season 2, it’s clear that Kitty doth protest too much when she insists that this new semester will be different. Season 1 ended with her being kicked out of KISS for living in the boys’ dorm, breaking up with her first love Dae (Minyeong Choi), discovering that she’s bisexual when she falls for her friend Yuri (Gia Kim), learning that her mom helped Yuri’s mom when she was pregnant in high school, and discovering that Dae’s best friend Min Ho (Sang Heon Lee) is in love with her. Season 2 begins with Kitty trying to abdicate her title as the school’s “chaos queen” so she can be single, live in a single dorm room, and use whatever time she’s not studying to learn more about her Korean mother, who attended KISS for her junior year of high school. While the plot in the first season incorporates lots of K-drama tropes (think Dae’s fake relationship with Yuri to bolster her parents’ hotel empire), the plot of the second season makes those tropes even more overt when Min Ho’s dad, one of the biggest talent managers in all of Asia, shows up to add a K-pop subplot. He teaches a new arts course at KISS and hosts a student talent showcase at the end of the semester in which students can compete for a cash prize and to open for Min Ho’s half-brother who is a K-pop star. Without spoiling anything, there is also a generational family secret and revenge plot to up the stakes for the K-drama as well. And there are new main characters to flesh out these storylines. Praveena (Sasha Bhasin), Stella (Audrey Huynh), Jin (Joshua Hyunho Lee) and Eunice (Han Bi Ryu) are all love interests and add conflict to Kitty’s core friend group. Fans of “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” will also be excited to know that two characters from that franchise make appearances in this season of “XO, Kitty.” Overall, the sophomore season of “XO, Kitty” is a fun watch. It’s neither significantly better nor worse than last season. Instead, it’s very on brand for what the show is, an American teen soap on Korean soil. As someone who never outgrew my love of a good teen show, I will say that “XO, Kitty” skews its storyline toward younger audiences. It’s not one of those teen shows that is also made for an adult audience, like Han’s “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” in which the adults in the show are given space for their own storylines and growth. The romance in “XO Kitty” is also more in line with traditional Korean K-dramas, so it’s goofier and much less sexually explicit. This makes it feel more Disney Channel than The CW (think “Lizzie McGuire” instead of “One Tree Hill” or “Gossip Girl”). However, the show also incorporates identity storylines around sexuality that are more progressive than most Korean television and more in line with American television.

Or, maybe it’s the kind of coming-of-age show that you watch as an adult because it helps you remember what it was like to experience love and friendship and travel for the first time. Either way, it’s a fun show that weaves together two genres that work well together, and, without spoiling the ending, this Korean American storyline will probably be continued in a third season, which, if you watch the show, you’ll definitely want to see.

    "title": "Zoe Saldaña Says James Cameron Messaged Her After Golden Globes Win: He 'Believes In Me'",
    "text": "“Avatar” actor Zoe Saldaña revealed that she was moved when James Cameron, the director behind the epic film series, reached out to her following her first Golden Globes win for her role in “Emilia Pérez.” Saldaña ― who won for her supporting role as Rita Mora Castro in Jacques Audiard’s Spanish-language musical film ― told reporters on Sunday that she was sitting in the audience when she “received a message from James Cameron,” who is in New Zealand cutting the third “Avatar” movie, “Fire and Ash.” “And he, after all these years, believes in me. So that, to me, nourishes my desire to continue growing as an artist,” said Saldaña, who plays Neytiri in the “Avatar” films. Cameron, in an interview with The Ringer’s “The Big Picture” podcast last month, said he’s seen Saldaña’s latest film three times and it “blew” him away. “It’s just not like any other film that’s ever been made, you know? I mean, I think it’s bold, it’s daring, it’s a vision,” Cameron told producer Gale Anne Hurd as the two discussed recent movies. “It’s beautifully executed. It’s a beautiful piece of filmmaking,” he said. He added that Saldaña is “fantastic” in the film, which took home four awards among a total of 10 nominations at the Golden Globes. “This is her season, maybe, to be recognized at the stature she should be recognized, So, there’s a lot of things in it that I just find fascinating,” Cameron said. Saldaña used her acceptance speech to show love to Audiard, her “Emilia Pérez” co-stars Karla Sofía Gascón and Selena Gomez, and her fellow nominees, whom she referred to as “magic.” Saldaña told reporters after the ceremony that she feels “absolute joy” as she reflected on not knowing what was ahead when she began her acting career over 25 years ago. “I’m indebted to filmmakers like Jacques Audiard that, after conversations and auditions and promises that I can do something, they really decide to bet on me and it works,” she said.
